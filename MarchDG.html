""Set out for the great city of Nineveh,<br>
and announce to it the message that I will tell you.""<br>
So Jonah made ready and went to Nineveh,<br>
according to the LORD's bidding.<br>
Now Nineveh was an enormously large city;<br>
it took three days to go through it.<br>
Jonah began his journey through the city,<br>
and had gone but a single day's walk announcing,<br>
""Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed,""<br>
when the people of Nineveh believed God;<br>
they proclaimed a fast<br>
and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth.<br><br>

When the news reached the king of Nineveh,<br>
he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe,<br>
covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.<br>
Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh,<br>
by decree of the king and his nobles:<br>
""Neither man nor beast, neither cattle nor sheep,<br>
shall taste anything;<br>
they shall not eat, nor shall they drink water.<br>
Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth and call loudly to God;<br>
every man shall turn from his evil way<br>
and from the violence he has in hand.<br>
Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and withhold his blazing wrath,<br>
so that we shall not perish.""<br>
When God saw by their actions how they turned from their evil way,<br>
he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to them;<br>
he did not carry it out.</td>

Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites,<br>
so will the Son of Man be to this generation.<br>
At the judgment<br>
the queen of the south will rise with the men of this generation<br>

to hear the wisdom of Solomon,<br>
and there is something greater than Solomon here.<br>
At the judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation<br>

O LORD, my God.<br><br>

Put in my mouth persuasive words in the presence of the lion<br>
and turn his heart to hatred for our enemy,<br>
