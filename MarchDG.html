it took three days to go through it.<br>
Jonah began his journey through the city,<br>

""Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed,""<br>
when the people of Nineveh believed God;<br>
they proclaimed a fast<br>
and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth.<br><br>

When the news reached the king of Nineveh,<br>
he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe,<br>
covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.<br>
Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh,<br>
by decree of the king and his nobles:<br>
""Neither man nor beast, neither cattle nor sheep,<br>
shall taste anything;<br>
they shall not eat, nor shall they drink water.<br>
Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth and call loudly to God;<br>
every man shall turn from his evil way<br>
and from the violence he has in hand.<br>
Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and withhold his blazing wrath,<br>
so that we shall not perish.""<br>
When God saw by their actions how they turned from their evil way,<br>
he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to them;<br>
he did not carry it out.</td>

he took the Twelve disciples aside by themselves,
and said to them on the way,
“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,
and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests
and the scribes,
and they will condemn him to death,
and hand him over to the Gentiles
to be mocked and scourged and crucified,
and he will be raised on the third day.”

Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons
and did him homage, wishing to ask him for something.
He said to her, “What do you wish?”
She answered him,
“Command that these two sons of mine sit,
one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom.”
Jesus said in reply,
“You do not know what you are asking.
Can you drink the chalice that I am going to drink?”
They said to him, “We can.”
He replied,
“My chalice you will indeed drink,
but to sit at my right and at my left,
this is not mine to give
but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”
When the ten heard this,
they became indignant at the two brothers.
But Jesus summoned them and said,
“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them,
and the great ones make their authority over them felt.
But it shall not be so among you.
Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant;
whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.
Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve
and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</td>

And lying at his door was a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,

Dogs even used to come and lick his sores.
When the poor man died,

The rich man also died and was buried,

he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off
and Lazarus at his side.
And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me.
Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue,
for I am suffering torment in these flames.'
Abraham replied, 'My child,
remember that you received what was good during your lifetime
while Lazarus likewise received what was bad;
but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented.
Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established
to prevent anyone from crossing
who might wish to go from our side to yours
or from your side to ours.'
He said, 'Then I beg you, father, send him
to my father's house,
for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them,
lest they too come to this place of torment.'
But Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets.
Let them listen to them.'
He said, 'Oh no, father Abraham,
but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'
Then Abraham said,
'If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded
if someone should rise from the dead.'"

            <td class="aceem">Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons,
for he was the child of his old age;
and he had made him a long tunic.
When his brothers saw that their father loved him best of all his sons,
they hated him so much that they would not even greet him.

One day, when his brothers had gone
to pasture their father's flocks at Shechem,
Israel said to Joseph,
"Your brothers, you know, are tending our flocks at Shechem.
Get ready; I will send you to them."

So Joseph went after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan.
They noticed him from a distance,
and before he came up to them, they plotted to kill him.
They said to one another: "Here comes that master dreamer!
Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns here;
we could say that a wild beast devoured him.
We shall then see what comes of his dreams."

When Reuben heard this,
he tried to save him from their hands, saying,
"We must not take his life.
Instead of shedding blood," he continued,
"just throw him into that cistern there in the desert;
but do not kill him outright."
His purpose was to rescue him from their hands
and return him to his father.
So when Joseph came up to them,
they stripped him of the long tunic he had on;
then they took him and threw him into the cistern,
which was empty and dry.

They then sat down to their meal.
Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead,
their camels laden with gum, balm and resin
to be taken down to Egypt.
Judah said to his brothers:
"What is to be gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood?
Rather, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites,
instead of doing away with him ourselves.
After all, he is our brother, our own flesh."
His brothers agreed.
They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.</td>

There was a landowner who planted a vineyard,
put a hedge around it,
dug a wine press in it, and built a tower.
Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.
When vintage time drew near,
he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce.
But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat,
another they killed, and a third they stoned.
Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones,
but they treated them in the same way.
Finally, he sent his son to them,
thinking, 'They will respect my son.'
But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another,
'This is the heir.
Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.'
They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?""
They answered him,
""He will put those wretched men to a wretched death
and lease his vineyard to other tenants
who will give him the produce at the proper times.""
Jesus said to them, ""Did you never read in the Scriptures:

The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone;
by the Lord has this been done,
and it is wonderful in our eyes?

Therefore, I say to you,
the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you
and given to a people that will produce its fruit.""
When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,
they knew that he was speaking about them.
And although they were attempting to arrest him,
they feared the crowds, for they regarded him as a prophet.

            <td class="aceem">Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,
but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying,
"This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."
So to them Jesus addressed this parable.
"A man had two sons, and the younger son said to his father,
'Father, give me the share of your estate that should come to me.'
So the father divided the property between them.
After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings
and set off to a distant country
where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.
When he had freely spent everything,
a severe famine struck that country,
and he found himself in dire need.
So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens
who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.
And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed,
but nobody gave him any.
Coming to his senses he thought,
'How many of my father's hired workers
have more than enough food to eat,
but here am I, dying from hunger.
I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him,
"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
I no longer deserve to be called your son;
treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers."'
So he got up and went back to his father.
While he was still a long way off,
his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion.
He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.
His son said to him,
'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you;
I no longer deserve to be called your son.'
But his father ordered his servants,
'Quickly, bring the finest robe and put it on him;
put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
Take the fattened calf and slaughter it.
Then let us celebrate with a feast,
because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again;
he was lost, and has been found.'
Then the celebration began.
Now the older son had been out in the field
and, on his way back, as he neared the house,
he heard the sound of music and dancing.
He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.
The servant said to him,
'Your brother has returned
and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf
because he has him back safe and sound.'
He became angry,
and when he refused to enter the house,
his father came out and pleaded with him.
He said to his father in reply,
'Look, all these years I served you
and not once did I disobey your orders;
yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.
But when your son returns
who swallowed up your property with prostitutes,
for him you slaughter the fattened calf.'
He said to him,
'My son, you are here with me always;
everything I have is yours.
But now we must celebrate and rejoice,
because your brother was dead and has come to life again;
he was lost and has been found.'"

Since we have been justified by faith, 
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
through whom we have gained access by faith 
to this grace in which we stand, 
and we boast in hope of the glory of God.

And hope does not disappoint, 
because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts 
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
For Christ, while we were still helpless, 
died at the appointed time for the ungodly.
Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person, 
though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die.
But God proves his love for us
in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Jesus came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, 
near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
Jacob’s well was there.
Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down there at the well.
It was about noon.

A woman of Samaria came to draw water.
Jesus said to her,
“Give me a drink.”
His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.
The Samaritan woman said to him,
“How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?”
—For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.—
Jesus answered and said to her,
“If you knew the gift of God
and who is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink, ‘
you would have asked him 
and he would have given you living water.”
The woman said to him, 
“Sir, you do not even have a bucket and the cistern is deep; 
where then can you get this living water?
Are you greater than our father Jacob, 
who gave us this cistern and drank from it himself 
with his children and his flocks?”
Jesus answered and said to her, 
“Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again; 
but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst; 
the water I shall give will become in him
a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”
The woman said to him,
“Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty 
or have to keep coming here to draw water.”

Jesus said to her,
“Go call your husband and come back.”
The woman answered and said to him,
“I do not have a husband.”
Jesus answered her,
“You are right in saying, ‘I do not have a husband.’
For you have had five husbands, 
and the one you have now is not your husband.
What you have said is true.”
The woman said to him,
“Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.
Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain; 
but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.”
Jesus said to her,
“Believe me, woman, the hour is coming
when you will worship the Father
neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
You people worship what you do not understand; 
we worship what we understand, 
because salvation is from the Jews.
But the hour is coming, and is now here, 
when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; 
and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him.
God is Spirit, and those who worship him
must worship in Spirit and truth.”
The woman said to him,
“I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called the Christ; 
when he comes, he will tell us everything.”
Jesus said to her,
“I am he, the one speaking with you.”

At that moment his disciples returned, 
and were amazed that he was talking with a woman, 
but still no one said, “What are you looking for?” 
or “Why are you talking with her?”
The woman left her water jar 
and went into the town and said to the people, 
“Come see a man who told me everything I have done.
Could he possibly be the Christ?”
They went out of the town and came to him.
Meanwhile, the disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat.”
But he said to them,
“I have food to eat of which you do not know.”
So the disciples said to one another, 
“Could someone have brought him something to eat?”
Jesus said to them,
“My food is to do the will of the one who sent me
and to finish his work.
Do you not say, ‘In four months the harvest will be here’?
I tell you, look up and see the fields ripe for the harvest.
The reaper is already receiving payment 
and gathering crops for eternal life, 
so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together.
For here the saying is verified that ‘One sows and another reaps.’
I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; 
others have done the work, 
and you are sharing the fruits of their work.” 

Many of the Samaritans of that town began to believe in him
because of the word of the woman who testified, 
“He told me everything I have done.”
When the Samaritans came to him,

they invited him to stay with them; 
and he stayed there two days.
Many more began to believe in him because of his word, 
and they said to the woman, 
“We no longer believe because of your word; 
for we have heard for ourselves, 
and we know that this is truly the savior of the world.”</td>

            <td class="aceem">Naaman, the army commander of the king of Aram,
was highly esteemed and respected by his master,
for through him the LORD had brought victory to Aram.
But valiant as he was, the man was a leper.
Now the Arameans had captured in a raid on the land of Israel
a little girl, who became the servant of Naaman’s wife.
“If only my master would present himself to the prophet in Samaria,”
she said to her mistress, “he would cure him of his leprosy.”
Naaman went and told his lord
just what the slave girl from the land of Israel had said.
“Go,” said the king of Aram.
“I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.”
So Naaman set out, taking along ten silver talents,
six thousand gold pieces, and ten festal garments.
To the king of Israel he brought the letter, which read:
“With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you,
that you may cure him of his leprosy.”

When he read the letter,
the king of Israel tore his garments and exclaimed:
“Am I a god with power over life and death,
that this man should send someone to me to be cured of leprosy?
Take note! You can see he is only looking for a quarrel with me!”
When Elisha, the man of God,
heard that the king of Israel had torn his garments,
he sent word to the king:
“Why have you torn your garments?
Let him come to me and find out
that there is a prophet in Israel.”

Naaman came with his horses and chariots
and stopped at the door of Elisha’s house.
The prophet sent him the message:
“Go and wash seven times in the Jordan,
and your flesh will heal, and you will be clean.”
But Naaman went away angry, saying,
“I thought that he would surely come out and stand there
to invoke the LORD his God,
and would move his hand over the spot,
and thus cure the leprosy.
Are not the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar,
better than all the waters of Israel?
Could I not wash in them and be cleansed?”
With this, he turned about in anger and left.

But his servants came up and reasoned with him.
“My father,” they said,
“if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary,
would you not have done it?
All the more now, since he said to you,
‘Wash and be clean,’ should you do as he said.”
So Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times
at the word of the man of God.
His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

He returned with his whole retinue to the man of God.
On his arrival he stood before him and said,
“Now I know that there is no God in all the earth,
except in Israel.”</td>

“Amen, I say to you,

Indeed, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel
in the days of Elijah
when the sky was closed for three and a half years
and a severe famine spread over the entire land.
It was to none of these that Elijah was sent,
but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon.
Again, there were many lepers in Israel
during the time of Elisha the prophet;
yet not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.”
When the people in the synagogue heard this,
they were all filled with fury.
They rose up, drove him out of the town,
and led him to the brow of the hill
on which their town had been built,
to hurl him down headlong.
But he passed through the midst of them and went away.

Jesus answered, "I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.
That is why the Kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king
who decided to settle accounts with his servants.
When he began the accounting,
a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.
Since he had no way of paying it back,
his master ordered him to be sold,
along with his wife, his children, and all his property,
in payment of the debt.
At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said,
'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'
Moved with compassion the master of that servant
let him go and forgave him the loan.
When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants
who owed him a much smaller amount.
He seized him and started to choke him, demanding,
'Pay back what you owe.'
Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,
'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'
But he refused.
Instead, he had him put in prison
until he paid back the debt.
Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened,
they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master
and reported the whole affair.
His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant!
I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.
Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant,
as I had pity on you?'
Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers
until he should pay back the whole debt.
So will my heavenly Father do to you,
unless each of you forgives your brother from your heart."

            <td class="aceem">As Jesus passed by he saw a man blind from birth.<br>
His disciples asked him,<br>
"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,<br>
that he was born blind?"<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
"Neither he nor his parents sinned;<br>
it is so that the works of God might be made visible through him.<br><br><br>
We have to do the works of the one who sent me while it is day.<br>
Night is coming when no one can work.<br>
While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."<br>
When he had said this, he spat on the ground<br>
and made clay with the saliva,<br>
and smeared the clay on his eyes,<br>
and said to him,<br>
"Go wash in the Pool of Siloam" —which means Sent—.<br>
So he went and washed, and came back able to see.<br><br>

His neighbors and those who had seen him earlier as a beggar said,<br>
"Isn't this the one who used to sit and beg?"<br>
Some said, "It is, "<br>
but others said, "No, he just looks like him."<br>
He said, "I am."<br>
So they said to him, "How were your eyes opened?"<br>
He replied,<br>
"The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes<br>
and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.'<br>
So I went there and washed and was able to see."<br>
And they said to him, "Where is he?"<br>
He said, "I don't know."<br><br>

They brought the one who was once blind to the Pharisees.<br>
Now Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes on a sabbath.<br>
So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see.<br>
He said to them,<br>
"He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see."<br>
So some of the Pharisees said,<br>
"This man is not from God,<br>
because he does not keep the sabbath."<br>
But others said,<br>
"How can a sinful man do such signs?"<br>
And there was a division among them.<br>
So they said to the blind man again,<br>
"What do you have to say about him,<br>
since he opened your eyes?"<br>
He said, "He is a prophet."<br>

Now the Jews did not believe<br>
that he had been blind and gained his sight<br>
until they summoned the parents of the one who had gained his sight.<br>
They asked them,<br>
"Is this your son, who you say was born blind?<br>
How does he now see?"<br>
His parents answered and said,<br>
"We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.<br>
We do not know how he sees now,<br>
nor do we know who opened his eyes.<br>
Ask him, he is of age;<br>
he can speak for himself."<br>
His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews,<br>
for the Jews had already agreed<br>
that if anyone acknowledged him as the Christ,<br>
he would be expelled from the synagogue.<br>
For this reason his parents said,<br>
"He is of age; question him."<br><br>

So a second time they called the man who had been blind<br>
and said to him, "Give God the praise!<br>
We know that this man is a sinner."<br>
He replied,<br>
"If he is a sinner, I do not know.<br>
One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see."<br>
So they said to him,<br>
"What did he do to you?<br>
How did he open your eyes?"<br>
He answered them,<br>
"I told you already and you did not listen.<br>
Why do you want to hear it again?<br>
Do you want to become his disciples, too?"<br>
They ridiculed him and said,<br>
"You are that man's disciple;<br>
we are disciples of Moses!<br>
We know that God spoke to Moses,<br>
but we do not know where this one is from."<br>
The man answered and said to them,<br>
"This is what is so amazing,<br>
that you do not know where he is from, yet he opened my eyes.<br>
We know that God does not listen to sinners,<br>
but if one is devout and does his will, he listens to him.<br>
It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born blind.<br>
If this man were not from God,<br>
he would not be able to do anything."<br>
They answered and said to him,<br>
"You were born totally in sin,<br>
and are you trying to teach us?"<br>
Then they threw him out.<br><br>

When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out,<br>
he found him and said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"<br>
He answered and said,<br>
"Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"<br>
Jesus said to him,<br>
"You have seen him,<br>
the one speaking with you is he."<br>
He said,<br>
"I do believe, Lord," and he worshiped him.<br>
Then Jesus said,<br>
"I came into this world for judgment,<br>
so that those who do not see might see,<br>
and those who do see might become blind."<br><br>

Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this<br>
and said to him, "Surely we are not also blind, are we?"<br>
Jesus said to them,<br>
"If you were blind, you would have no sin;<br>
but now you are saying, 'We see,' so your sin remains.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Jesus answered the Jews:<br>
"My Father is at work until now, so I am at work."<br>
For this reason they tried all the more to kill him,<br>
because he not only broke the sabbath<br>
but he also called God his own father, making himself equal to God.<br><br>

Jesus answered and said to them,<br>
"Amen, amen, I say to you, the Son cannot do anything on his own,<br>
but only what he sees the Father doing;<br>
for what he does, the Son will do also.<br>
For the Father loves the Son<br>
and shows him everything that he himself does,<br>
and he will show him greater works than these,<br>
so that you may be amazed.<br>
For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life,<br>
so also does the Son give life to whomever he wishes.<br>
Nor does the Father judge anyone,<br>
but he has given all judgment to the Son,<br>
so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father.<br>
Whoever does not honor the Son<br>
does not honor the Father who sent him.<br>
Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever hears my word<br>
and believes in the one who sent me<br>
has eternal life and will not come to condemnation,<br>
but has passed from death to life.<br>
Amen, amen, I say to you, the hour is coming and is now here<br>
when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God,<br>
and those who hear will live.<br>
For just as the Father has life in himself,<br>
so also he gave to the Son the possession of life in himself.<br>
And he gave him power to exercise judgment,<br>
because he is the Son of Man.<br>
Do not be amazed at this,<br>
because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs<br>
will hear his voice and will come out,<br>
those who have done good deeds<br>
to the resurrection of life,<br>
but those who have done wicked deeds<br>
to the resurrection of condemnation.<br><br>

"I cannot do anything on my own;<br>
I judge as I hear, and my judgment is just,<br>
because I do not seek my own will<br>
but the will of the one who sent me."</td>

            <td class="aceem">Now a man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, <br>
the village of Mary and her sister Martha.<br>
Mary was the one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil <br>
and dried his feet with her hair; <br>
it was her brother Lazarus who was ill.<br>
So the sisters sent word to him saying, <br>
“Master, the one you love is ill.”<br>
When Jesus heard this he said,<br>
“This illness is not to end in death, <br>
but is for the glory of God, <br>
that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”<br>
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<br>
So when he heard that he was ill, <br>
he remained for two days in the place where he was.<br>
Then after this he said to his disciples, <br>
“Let us go back to Judea.”<br>
The disciples said to him, <br>
“Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, <br>
and you want to go back there?”<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
“Are there not twelve hours in a day?<br>
If one walks during the day, he does not stumble, <br>
because he sees the light of this world.<br>
But if one walks at night, he stumbles, <br>
because the light is not in him.” <br>
He said this, and then told them,<br>
“Our friend Lazarus is asleep,<br>
but I am going to awaken him.”<br>
So the disciples said to him,<br>
“Master, if he is asleep, he will be saved.”<br>
But Jesus was talking about his death, <br>
while they thought that he meant ordinary sleep. <br>
So then Jesus said to them clearly,<br>
“Lazarus has died.<br>
And I am glad for you that I was not there,<br>
that you may believe. <br>
Let us go to him.”<br>
So Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, <br>
“Let us also go to die with him.”<br><br>

When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus <br>
had already been in the tomb for four days.<br>
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away.<br>
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary <br>
to comfort them about their brother.<br>
When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,<br>
she went to meet him;<br>
but Mary sat at home.<br>
Martha said to Jesus, <br>
“Lord, if you had been here,<br>
my brother would not have died.<br>
But even now I know that whatever you ask of God,<br>
God will give you.”<br>
Jesus said to her,<br>
“Your brother will rise.”<br>
Martha said to him,<br>
“I know he will rise,<br>
in the resurrection on the last day.”<br>
Jesus told her,<br>
“I am the resurrection and the life; <br>
whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live, <br>
and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.<br>
Do you believe this?”<br>
She said to him, “Yes, Lord.<br>
I have come to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God,<br>
the one who is coming into the world.”<br><br>

When she had said this, <br>
she went and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, <br>
“The teacher is here and is asking for you.”<br>
As soon as she heard this,<br>
she rose quickly and went to him.<br>
For Jesus had not yet come into the village, <br>
but was still where Martha had met him.<br>
So when the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her <br>
saw Mary get up quickly and go out,<br>
they followed her, <br>
presuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there.<br>
When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, <br>
she fell at his feet and said to him, <br>
“Lord, if you had been here,<br>
my brother would not have died.”<br>
When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping, <br>
he became perturbed and deeply troubled, and said, <br>
“Where have you laid him?”<br>
They said to him, “Sir, come and see.”<br>
And Jesus wept.<br>
So the Jews said, “See how he loved him.”<br>
But some of them said, <br>
“Could not the one who opened the eyes of the blind man <br>
have done something so that this man would not have died?”<br><br>

So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb.<br>
It was a cave, and a stone lay across it.<br>
Jesus said, “Take away the stone.”<br>
Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to him, <br>
“Lord, by now there will be a stench; <br>
he has been dead for four days.”<br>
Jesus said to her,<br>
“Did I not tell you that if you believe <br>
you will see the glory of God?”<br>
So they took away the stone.<br>
And Jesus raised his eyes and said,<br>
“Father, I thank you for hearing me.<br>
I know that you always hear me; <br>
but because of the crowd here I have said this, <br>
that they may believe that you sent me.”<br>
And when he had said this,<br>
He cried out in a loud voice, <br>
“Lazarus, come out!”<br>
The dead man came out,<br>
tied hand and foot with burial bands, <br>
and his face was wrapped in a cloth.<br>
So Jesus said to them,<br>
“Untie him and let him go.”<br><br>

Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary<br>
and seen what he had done began to believe in him.

            <td class="aceem">In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim,<br>
who married a very beautiful and God-fearing woman, Susanna,<br>
the daughter of Hilkiah;<br>
her pious parents had trained their daughter<br>
according to the law of Moses.<br>
Joakim was very rich;<br>
he had a garden near his house,<br>
and the Jews had recourse to him often<br>
because he was the most respected of them all.<br>

That year, two elders of the people were appointed judges,<br>
of whom the Lord said, “Wickedness has come out of Babylon:<br>
from the elders who were to govern the people as judges.”<br>
These men, to whom all brought their cases,<br>
frequented the house of Joakim.<br>
When the people left at noon,<br>
Susanna used to enter her husband’s garden for a walk.<br>
When the old men saw her enter every day for her walk,<br>
they began to lust for her.<br>
They suppressed their consciences;<br>
they would not allow their eyes to look to heaven,<br>
and did not keep in mind just judgments.<br><br>

One day, while they were waiting for the right moment,<br>
she entered the garden as usual, with two maids only.<br>
She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.<br>
Nobody else was there except the two elders,<br>
who had hidden themselves and were watching her.<br>
“Bring me oil and soap,” she said to the maids,<br>
“and shut the garden doors while I bathe.”<br><br>

As soon as the maids had left,<br>
the two old men got up and hurried to her.<br>
“Look,” they said, “the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us;<br>
give in to our desire, and lie with us.<br>
If you refuse, we will testify against you<br>
that you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.”<br><br>

“I am completely trapped,” Susanna groaned.<br>
“If I yield, it will be my death;<br>
if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.<br>
Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guilt<br>
than to sin before the Lord.”<br>
Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,<br>
as one of them ran to open the garden doors.<br>
When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden,<br>
they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.<br>
At the accusations by the old men,<br>
the servants felt very much ashamed,<br>
for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.<br><br>

When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day,<br>
the two wicked elders also came,<br>
fully determined to put Susanna to death.<br>
Before all the people they ordered:<br>
“Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah,<br>
the wife of Joakim.”<br>
When she was sent for,<br>
she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.<br>
All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.<br>v

In the midst of the people the two elders rose up<br>
and laid their hands on her head.<br>
Through tears she looked up to heaven,<br>
for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.<br>
The elders made this accusation:<br>
“As we were walking in the garden alone,<br>
this woman entered with two girls<br>
and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.<br>
A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.<br>
When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime,<br>
we ran toward them.<br>
We saw them lying together,<br>
but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we;<br>
he opened the doors and ran off.<br>
Then we seized her and asked who the young man was,<br>
but she refused to tell us.<br>
We testify to this.”<br>
The assembly believed them,<br>
since they were elders and judges of the people,<br>
and they condemned her to death.<br>v

But Susanna cried aloud:<br>
“O eternal God, you know what is hidden<br>
and are aware of all things before they come to be:<br>
you know that they have testified falsely against me. <br>
Here I am about to die,<br>
though I have done none of the things<br>
with which these wicked men have charged me.”<br><br>

The Lord heard her prayer.<br>
As she was being led to execution,<br>
God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,<br>
and he cried aloud:<br>
“I will have no part in the death of this woman.”<br>
All the people turned and asked him, “What is this you are saying?”<br>
He stood in their midst and continued,<br>
“Are you such fools, O children of Israel! <br>
To condemn a woman of Israel without examination<br>
and without clear evidence?<br>
Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.”<br><br>

Then all the people returned in haste.<br>
To Daniel the elders said,<br>
“Come, sit with us and inform us,<br>
since God has given you the prestige of old age.”<br>
But he replied,<br>
“Separate these two far from each other that I may examine them.”<br><br>

After they were separated one from the other,<br>
he called one of them and said:<br>
“How you have grown evil with age!<br>
Now have your past sins come to term:<br>
passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent,<br>
and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says,<br>
‘The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.’<br>
Now, then, if you were a witness,<br>
tell me under what tree you saw them together.”<br>
“Under a mastic tree,” he answered.<br>
Daniel replied, “Your fine lie has cost you your head,<br>
for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him<br>
and split you in two.”<br>
Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought.<br>
Daniel said to him,<br>
“Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah, beauty has seduced you,<br>
lust has subverted your conscience.<br>
This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel,<br>
and in their fear they yielded to you;<br>
but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.<br>
Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.”<br>
“Under an oak,” he said.<br>
Daniel replied, “Your fine lie has cost you also your head,<br>
for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two<br>
so as to make an end of you both.”<br><br>

The whole assembly cried aloud,<br>
blessing God who saves those who hope in him.<br>
They rose up against the two elders,<br>
for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury.<br>
According to the law of Moses,<br>
they inflicted on them<br>
the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:<br>
they put them to death.<br>
Thus was innocent blood spared that day.</td>

Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman <br>

“Let the one among you who is without sin <br>
be the first to throw a stone at her.”<br>

Go, and from now on do not sin any more.”</td>

But with their patience worn out by the journey,
the people complained against God and Moses,
"Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in this desert,
where there is no food or water?
We are disgusted with this wretched food!"

In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents,
which bit the people so that many of them died.
Then the people came to Moses and said,
"We have sinned in complaining against the LORD and you.
Pray the LORD to take the serpents away from us."
So Moses prayed for the people, and the LORD said to Moses,

Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole,
