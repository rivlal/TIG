            <td class="aceem">The Apostles and the brothers who were in Judea<br>
heard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God.<br>
So when Peter went up to Jerusalem<br>
the circumcised believers confronted him, saying,<br>
'You entered the house of uncircumcised people and ate with them."<br>
Peter began and explained it to them step by step, saying,<br>
"I was at prayer in the city of Joppa<br>
when in a trance I had a vision,<br>
something resembling a large sheet coming down,<br>
lowered from the sky by its four corners, and it came to me.<br>
Looking intently into it,<br>
I observed and saw the four-legged animals of the earth,<br>
the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky.<br>
I also heard a voice say to me, 'Get up, Peter. Slaughter and eat.'<br>
But I said, 'Certainly not, sir,<br>
because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'<br>
But a second time a voice from heaven answered,<br>
'What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.'<br>
This happened three times,<br>
and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.<br>
Just then three men appeared at the house where we were,<br>
who had been sent to me from Caesarea.<br>
The Spirit told me to accompany them without discriminating.<br>
These six brothers also went with me,<br>
and we entered the man's house.<br>
He related to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, saying,<br>
'Send someone to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter,<br>
who will speak words to you<br>
by which you and all your household will be saved.'<br>
As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them<br>
as it had upon us at the beginning,<br>
and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said,<br>
'John baptized with water<br>
but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'<br>
If then God gave them the same gift he gave to us<br>
when we came to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
who was I to be able to hinder God?"<br>
When they heard this,<br>
they stopped objecting and glorified God, saying,<br>
"God has then granted life-giving repentance to the Gentiles too."</td>

After these things he provided judges up to Samuel the prophet.<br>

a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.<br>
Then he removed him and raised up David as their king;
of him he testified,<br>

From this man's descendants God, according to his promise,<br>

            <td class="aceem">On the following sabbath<br>
almost the whole city<br>
gathered to hear the word of the Lord.<br>
When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy<br>
and with violent abuse contradicted what Paul said.<br>
Both Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said,<br>
"It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first,<br>
but since you reject it<br>
and condemn yourselves as unworthy of eternal life,<br>
we now turn to the Gentiles.<br>
<i>For so the Lord has commanded us,<br>
I have made you a light to the Gentiles,<br>
that you may be an instrument of salvation<br>
    to the ends of the earth."</i><br><br>

The Gentiles were delighted when they heard this<br>
and glorified the word of the Lord.<br>
All who were destined for eternal life came to believe,<br>
and the word of the Lord continued to spread<br>
through the whole region.<br>
The Jews, however, incited the women of prominence who were worshipers<br>
and the leading men of the city,<br>
stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas,<br>
and expelled them from their territory.<br>
So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them<br>
and went to Iconium.<br>
The disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</td>

            <td class="aceem">There was an attempt in Iconium<br>
by both the Gentiles and the Jews,<br>
together with their leaders,<br>
to attack and stone Paul and Barnabas.<br>
They realized it,<br>
and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe<br>
and to the surrounding countryside,<br>
where they continued to proclaim the Good News.<br><br>

At Lystra there was a crippled man, lame from birth,<br>
who had never walked.<br>
He listened to Paul speaking, who looked intently at him,<br>
saw that he had the faith to be healed,<br>
and called out in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet."<br>
He jumped up and began to walk about.<br>
When the crowds saw what Paul had done,<br>
they cried out in Lycaonian,<br>
"The gods have come down to us in human form."<br>
They called Barnabas "Zeus" and Paul "Hermes,"<br>
because he was the chief speaker.<br>
And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city,<br>
brought oxen and garlands to the gates,<br>
for he together with the people intended to offer sacrifice.<br><br>

The Apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their garments<br>
when they heard this and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,<br>
"Men, why are you doing this?<br>
We are of the same nature as you, human beings.<br>
We proclaim to you good news<br>
that you should turn from these idols to the living God,<br>
<i>who made heaven and earth and sea and all that is in them.</i><br>
In past generations he allowed all Gentiles to go their own ways;<br>
yet, in bestowing his goodness,<br>
he did not leave himself without witness,<br>
for he gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,<br>
and filled you with nourishment and gladness for your hearts."<br>

God made his choice among you that through my mouth<br>

He made no distinction between us and them,<br>

Why, then, are you now putting God to the test<br>

a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?<br>
On the contrary, we believe that we are saved<br>
through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they."<br>
The whole assembly fell silent,<br>
and they listened<br>
while Paul and Barnabas described the signs and wonders<br>
God had worked among the Gentiles through them.<br><br>

After they had fallen silent, James responded,<br>
"My brothers, listen to me.<br>
Symeon has described how God first concerned himself<br>
with acquiring from among the Gentiles a people for his name.<br>
The words of the prophets agree with this, as is written:<br><br>

<i>After this I shall return<br>
and rebuild the fallen hut of David;<br>
from its ruins I shall rebuild it<br>
and raise it up again,<br>
so that the rest of humanity may seek out the Lord,<br>
even all the Gentiles on whom my name is invoked.<br>
Thus says the Lord who accomplishes these things,<br>
    known from of old.</i><br><br>

It is my judgment, therefore,<br>
that we ought to stop troubling the Gentiles who turn to God,<br>
but tell them by letter to avoid pollution from idols,<br>
unlawful marriage, the meat of strangled animals, and blood.<br>
For Moses, for generations now,<br>
has had those who proclaim him in every town,<br>

            <td class="aceem">The Apostles and presbyters, in agreement with the whole Church,<br>
decided to choose representatives<br>
and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas.<br>
The ones chosen were Judas, who was called Barsabbas,<br>
and Silas, leaders among the brothers.<br>
This is the letter delivered by them:<br>
"The Apostles and the presbyters, your brothers,<br>
to the brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia<br>
of Gentile origin: greetings.<br>
Since we have heard that some of our number<br>
who went out without any mandate from us<br>
have upset you with their teachings<br>
and disturbed your peace of mind,<br>
we have with one accord decided to choose representatives<br>
and to send them to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,<br>
who have dedicated their lives to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
So we are sending Judas and Silas<br>
who will also convey this same message by word of mouth:<br>
'It is the decision of the Holy Spirit and of us<br>
not to place on you any burden beyond these necessities,<br>
namely, to abstain from meat sacrificed to idols,<br>
from blood, from meats of strangled animals,<br>
and from unlawful marriage.<br>
If you keep free of these,<br>
you will be doing what is right. Farewell.'"<br><br>

And so they were sent on their journey.<br>
Upon their arrival in Antioch<br>
they called the assembly together and delivered the letter.<br>
When the people read it, they were delighted with the exhortation.</td>

            <td class="aceem">After Paul's escorts had taken him to Athens,<br>
they came away with instructions for Silas and Timothy<br>
to join him as soon as possible.<br><br>

Then Paul stood up at the Areopagus and said:<br>
"You Athenians, I see that in every respect<br>
you are very religious.<br>
For as I walked around looking carefully at your shrines,<br>
I even discovered an altar inscribed, 'To an Unknown God.'<br>
What therefore you unknowingly worship, I proclaim to you.<br>
The God who made the world and all that is in it,<br>
the Lord of heaven and earth,<br>
does not dwell in sanctuaries made by human hands,<br>
nor is he served by human hands because he needs anything.<br>
Rather it is he who gives to everyone life and breath and everything.<br>
He made from one the whole human race<br>
to dwell on the entire surface of the earth,<br>
and he fixed the ordered seasons and the boundaries of their regions,<br>
so that people might seek God,<br>
even perhaps grope for him and find him,<br>
though indeed he is not far from any one of us.<br>
For 'In him we live and move and have our being,'<br>
as even some of your poets have said,<br>
'For we too are his offspring.'<br>
Since therefore we are the offspring of God,<br>
we ought not to think that the divinity is like an image<br>
fashioned from gold, silver, or stone by human art and imagination.<br>
God has overlooked the times of ignorance,<br>
but now he demands that all people everywhere repent<br>
because he has established a day on which he will 'judge the world<br>
with justice' through a man he has appointed,<br>
and he has provided confirmation for all<br>
by raising him from the dead."<br><br>

When they heard about resurrection of the dead,<br>
some began to scoff, but others said,<br>
"We should like to hear you on this some other time."<br>
And so Paul left them.<br>
But some did join him, and became believers.<br>
Among them were Dionysius,<br>
a member of the Court of the Areopagus,<br>
a woman named Damaris, and others with them.<br><br>

After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.</td>

“This man is inducing people to worship God contrary to the law.”<br>
When Paul was about to reply, Gallio spoke to the Jews,<br>
“If it were a matter of some crime or malicious fraud,<br>
I should with reason hear the complaint of you Jews;<br>
but since it is a question of arguments over doctrine and titles<br>
and your own law, see to it yourselves.<br>
I do not wish to be a judge of such matters.”<br>
And he drove them away from the tribunal.<br>
They all seized Sosthenes, the synagogue official,<br>

Paul remained for quite some time,<br>

It is this disciple who testifies to these things<br>
and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.<br>
There are also many other things that Jesus did,<br>
but if these were to be described individually,<br>
I do not think the whole world would contain the books
that would be written.</td>

            and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.

            and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,<br>
            and Mary of Magdala.<br>
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved,<br>
            he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.”<br>
Then he said to the disciple,<br>
            “Behold, your mother.”<br>
And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br>
After this, aware that everything was now finished,<br>
            in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled,<br>
            Jesus said, “I thirst.”<br>
There was a vessel filled with common wine.<br>
So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop<br>
            and put it up to his mouth.<br>
When Jesus had taken the wine, he said,<br>
            “It is finished.”<br>
And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.<br>

Now since it was preparation day,<br>
            in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,<br>
            for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one,<br>
            the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken<br>
            and they be taken down.<br>
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first<br>
            and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.<br>
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead,<br>
            they did not break his legs,<br>
            but one soldier thrust his lance into his side,<br>
            and immediately Blood and water flowed out.</td>

would be fulfilled."<br><br>

the Almighty has done great things for me,<br>

He has shown the strength of his arm,<br>
he has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br>
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
