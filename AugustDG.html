            <td class="aceem">The tent, which was called the meeting tent,<br>
Moses used to pitch at some distance away, outside the camp.<br>
Anyone who wished to consult the LORD<br>
would go to this meeting tent outside the camp.<br>
Whenever Moses went out to the tent, the people would all rise<br>
and stand at the entrance of their own tents,<br>
watching Moses until he entered the tent.<br>
As Moses entered the tent, the column of cloud would come down<br>
and stand at its entrance while the LORD spoke with Moses.<br>
On seeing the column of cloud stand at the entrance of the tent,<br>
all the people would rise and worship<br>
at the entrance of their own tents.<br>
The LORD used to speak to Moses face to face,<br>
as one man speaks to another.<br>
Moses would then return to the camp,<br>
but his young assistant, Joshua, son of Nun,<br>
would not move out of the tent.<br><br>

Moses stood there with the LORD and proclaimed his name, "LORD."<br>
Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out,<br>
"The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God,<br>
slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity,<br>
continuing his kindness for a thousand generations,<br>
and forgiving wickedness and crime and sin;<br>
yet not declaring the guilty guiltless,<br>
but punishing children and grandchildren<br>
to the third and fourth generation for their fathers' wickedness!"<br>
Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.<br>
Then he said, "If I find favor with you, O LORD,<br>
do come along in our company.<br>
This is indeed a stiff-necked people;<br>
yet pardon our wickedness and sins,<br>
and receive us as your own."<br><br>

So Moses stayed there with the LORD for forty days and forty nights,<br>
without eating any food or drinking any water,<br>
and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant,<br>
the ten commandments.</td>

His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl,<br>

His disciples came and took away the corpse<br>

After reconnoitering the land for forty days they returned,<br>
met Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation of the children of Israel<br>
in the desert of Paran at Kadesh,<br>
made a report to them all,<br>

They told Moses: "We went into the land to which you sent us.<br>
It does indeed flow with milk and honey, and here is its fruit.<br>
However, the people who are living in the land are fierce,<br>

Amalekites live in the region of the Negeb;<br>
Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites dwell in the highlands,<br>
and Canaanites along the seacoast and the banks of the Jordan."<br><br>

Caleb, however, to quiet the people toward Moses, said,<br>
"We ought to go up and seize the land, for we can certainly do so."<br>
But the men who had gone up with him said,<br>
"We cannot attack these people; they are too strong for us."<br>
So they spread discouraging reports among the children of Israel<br>

"The land that we explored is a country that consumes its inhabitants.<br>
And all the people we saw there are huge, veritable giants<br>
(the Anakim were a race of giants);<br>
we felt like mere grasshoppers, and so we must have seemed to them."<br><br>

At this, the whole community broke out with loud cries,<br>
and even in the night the people wailed.<br>

The LORD said to Moses and Aaron:<br>
"How long will this wicked assembly grumble against me?<br>
I have heard the grumblings of the children of Israel against me.<br>
Tell them: By my life, says the LORD,<br>
I will do to you just what I have heard you say.<br>
Here in the desert shall your dead bodies fall.<br>
Forty days you spent in scouting the land;<br>
forty years shall you suffer for your crimes:<br>

            <td class="aceem">Moses said to the people:<br>
"Ask now of the days of old, before your time,<br>
ever since God created man upon the earth;<br>
ask from one end of the sky to the other:<br>
Did anything so great ever happen before?<br>
Was it ever heard of?<br>
Did a people ever hear the voice of God<br>
speaking from the midst of fire, as you did, and live?<br>
Or did any god venture to go and take a nation for himself<br>
from the midst of another nation,<br>
by testings, by signs and wonders, by war,<br>
with his strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great terrors,<br>
all of which the LORD, your God,<br>
did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?<br>
All this you were allowed to see<br>
that you might know the LORD is God and there is no other.<br>
Out of the heavens he let you hear his voice to discipline you;<br>
on earth he let you see his great fire,<br>
and you heard him speaking out of the fire.<br>
For love of your fathers he chose their descendants<br>
and personally led you out of Egypt by his great power,<br>
driving out of your way nations greater and mightier than you,<br>
so as to bring you in<br>
and to make their land your heritage, as it is today.<br>
This is why you must now know, and fix in your heart,<br>
that the LORD is God in the heavens above and on earth below,<br>
and that there is no other.<br>
You must keep his statutes and commandments which I enjoin on you today,<br>
that you and your children after you may prosper,<br>
and that you may have long life on the land<br>
which the LORD, your God, is giving you forever."</td>

in every generation.<br>
He has shown the strength of his arm,<br>
and has scattered the proud in their conceit.<br>
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
and has lifted up the lowly.<br>
He has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
and the rich he has sent away empty.<br>
He has come to the help of his servant Israel<br>
for he has remembered his promise of mercy,<br>
the promise he made to our fathers,<br>
to Abraham and his children forever.”<br>

            <td class="aceem">Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,<br>
the headland of Pisgah which faces Jericho,<br>
and the LORD showed him all the land—<br>
Gilead, and as far as Dan, all Naphtali,<br>
the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,<br>
all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,<br>
the Negeb, the circuit of the Jordan<br>
with the lowlands at Jericho, city of palms,<br>
and as far as Zoar.<br>
The LORD then said to him,<br>
"This is the land<br>
which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob<br>
that I would give to their descendants.<br>
I have let you feast your eyes upon it, but you shall not cross over."<br>
So there, in the land of Moab, Moses, the servant of the LORD,<br>
died as the LORD had said; and he was buried in the ravine<br>
opposite Beth-peor in the land of Moab,<br>
but to this day no one knows the place of his burial.<br>
Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died,<br>
yet his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated.<br>
For thirty days the children of Israel wept for Moses<br>
in the plains of Moab, till they had completed<br>
the period of grief and mourning for Moses.<br>

Now Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom,<br>
since Moses had laid his hands upon him;<br>
and so the children of Israel gave him their obedience,<br>
thus carrying out the LORD's command to Moses.<br>

Since then no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses,<br>
whom the LORD knew face to face.<br>
He had no equal in all the signs and wonders<br>
the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt<br>
against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land,<br>
and for the might and the terrifying power<br>
that Moses exhibited in the sight of all Israel.</td>

waded into the waters at the edge of the Jordan,<br>

As many as seven times?"<br>
Jesus answered, "I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.<br>
That is why the Kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king<br>
who decided to settle accounts with his servants.<br>
When he began the accounting,<br>
a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.<br>
Since he had no way of paying it back,<br>
his master ordered him to be sold,<br>
along with his wife, his children, and all his property,<br>
in payment of the debt.<br>
At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said,<br>
'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'<br>
Moved with compassion the master of that servant<br>
let him go and forgave him the loan.<br>
When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants<br>
who owed him a much smaller amount.<br>
He seized him and started to choke him, demanding,<br>
'Pay back what you owe.'<br>
Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,<br>
'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'<br>
But he refused.<br>
Instead, he had the fellow servant put in prison<br>
until he paid back the debt.<br>
Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened,<br>
they were deeply disturbed,<br>
and went to their master and reported the whole affair.<br>
His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant!<br>
I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.<br>
Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant,<br>
as I had pity on you?'<br>
Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers<br>
until he should pay back the whole debt.<br>
So will my heavenly Father do to you,<br>
unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart."<br><br>

When Jesus finished these words, he left Galilee<br>
and went to the district of Judea across the Jordan.</td>

summoning their elders, their leaders,<br>
their judges and their officers.<br>
When they stood in ranks before God, Joshua addressed all the people:<br>
"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel:<br>
In times past your fathers, down to Terah,<br>
father of Abraham and Nahor,<br>
dwelt beyond the River and served other gods.<br>
But I brought your father Abraham from the region beyond the River<br>
and led him through the entire land of Canaan.<br>
I made his descendants numerous, and gave him Isaac.<br>
To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau.<br>
To Esau I assigned the mountain region of Seir in which to settle,<br>
while Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.<br>

"Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and smote Egypt with the prodigies<br>
which I wrought in her midst.<br>
Afterward I led you out of Egypt, and when you reached the sea,<br>
the Egyptians pursued your fathers to the Red Sea<br>
with chariots and horsemen.<br>
Because they cried out to the LORD,<br>
he put darkness between your people and the Egyptians,<br>
upon whom he brought the sea so that it engulfed them.<br>
After you witnessed what I did to Egypt,<br>
and dwelt a long time in the desert,<br>
I brought you into the land of the Amorites<br>
who lived east of the Jordan.<br>
They fought against you, but I delivered them into your power.<br>
You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them,<br>
the two kings of the Amorites, before you.<br>
Then Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab,<br>
prepared to war against Israel.<br>
He summoned Balaam, son of Beor, to curse you;<br>
but I would not listen to Balaam.<br>
On the contrary, he had to bless you, and I saved you from him.<br>
Once you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho,<br>
the men of Jericho fought against you,<br>
but I delivered them also into your power.<br>
And I sent the hornets ahead of you that drove them<br>
(the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites,<br>
Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites)<br>
out of your way; it was not your sword or your bow.<br>

and cities that you had not built, to dwell in;<br>
you have eaten of vineyards and olive groves<br>
which you did not plant."</td>

He said in reply, "Have you not read that from the beginning<br>

<i>For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother<br>
    and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?</i><br>
So they are no longer two, but one flesh.<br>
Therefore, what God has joined together, man must not separate."<br>
They said to him, "Then why did Moses command<br>
that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss her?"<br>
He said to them, "Because of the hardness of your hearts<br>
Moses allowed you to divorce your wives,<br>
but from the beginning it was not so.<br>
I say to you, whoever divorces his wife<br>
(unless the marriage is unlawful)<br>
and marries another commits adultery."<br>
His disciples said to him,<br>
"If that is the case of a man with his wife,<br>
it is better not to marry."<br>
He answered, "Not all can accept this word,<br>
but only those to whom that is granted.<br>
Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so;<br>
some, because they were made so by others;<br>
some, because they have renounced marriage<br>
for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven.<br>
Whoever can accept this ought to accept it."

"Fear the LORD and serve him completely and sincerely.<br>
Cast out the gods your fathers served beyond the River and in Egypt,<br>
and serve the LORD.<br>
If it does not please you to serve the LORD,<br>
decide today whom you will serve,<br>
the gods your fathers served beyond the River<br>
or the gods of the Amorites in whose country you are dwelling.<br>
As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."<br><br>

But the people answered, "Far be it from us to forsake the LORD<br>
for the service of other gods.<br>
For it was the LORD, our God,<br>
who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt,<br>
out of a state of slavery.<br>
He performed those great miracles before our very eyes<br>
and protected us along our entire journey and among all the peoples<br>
through whom we passed.<br>
At our approach the LORD drove out all the peoples,<br>
including the Amorites who dwelt in the land.<br>
Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."<br><br>

Joshua in turn said to the people,<br>
"You may not be able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy God;<br>
he is a jealous God who will not forgive<br>
your transgressions or your sins.<br>
If, after the good he has done for you,<br>
you forsake the LORD and serve strange gods,<br>
he will do evil to you and destroy you."<br><br>

But the people answered Joshua, "We will still serve the LORD."<br>
Joshua therefore said to the people,<br>
"You are your own witnesses that you have chosen to serve the LORD."<br>
They replied, "We are, indeed!"<br>
Joshua continued:<br>
"Now, therefore, put away the strange gods that are among you<br>
and turn your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."<br>
Then the people promised Joshua,<br>
"We will serve the LORD, our God, and obey his voice."<br><br>

So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day<br>
and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem,<br>
which he recorded in the book of the law of God.<br>
Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak<br>
that was in the sanctuary of the LORD.<br>

for it has heard all the words which the LORD spoke to us.<br>
It shall be a witness against you, should you wish to deny your God."<br>
Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his own heritage.<br><br>

            <td class="aceem">The children of Israel offended the LORD by serving the Baals.<br>
Abandoning the LORD, the God of their fathers,<br>
who led them out of the land of Egypt,<br>
they followed the other gods of the various nations around them,<br>
and by their worship of these gods provoked the LORD.<br><br>

Because they had thus abandoned him and served Baal and the Ashtaroth,<br>
the anger of the LORD flared up against Israel,<br>
and he delivered them over to plunderers who despoiled them.<br>
He allowed them to fall into the power of their enemies round about<br>
whom they were no longer able to withstand.<br>
Whatever they undertook, the LORD turned into disaster for them,<br>
as in his warning he had sworn he would do,<br>
till they were in great distress.<br>
Even when the LORD raised up judges to deliver them<br>
from the power of their despoilers,<br>
they did not listen to their judges,<br>
but abandoned themselves to the worship of other gods.<br>
They were quick to stray from the way their fathers had taken,<br>
and did not follow their example of obedience<br>
to the commandments of the LORD. <br>
Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, he would be with the judge<br>
and save them from the power of their enemies<br>
as long as the judge lived;<br>
it was thus the LORD took pity on their distressful cries<br>
of affliction under their oppressors.<br>
But when the judge died,<br>
they would relapse and do worse than their ancestors,<br>
following other gods in service and worship,<br>
relinquishing none of their evil practices or stubborn conduct.</td>

            <td class="aceem">The angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth in Ophrah<br>
that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite.<br>
While his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press<br>
to save it from the Midianites,<br>
the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said,<br>
"The LORD is with you, O champion!"<br>
Gideon said to him, "My Lord, if the LORD is with us,<br>
why has all this happened to us?<br>
Where are his wondrous deeds of which our fathers<br>
told us when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?'<br>
For now the LORD has abandoned us<br>
and has delivered us into the power of Midian."<br>
The LORD turned to him and said, "Go with the strength you have<br>
and save Israel from the power of Midian.<br>
It is I who send you."<br>
But Gideon answered him, "Please, my lord, how can I save Israel?<br>
My family is the lowliest in Manasseh,<br>
and I am the most insignificant in my father's house."<br>
"I shall be with you," the LORD said to him,<br>
"and you will cut down Midian to the last man."<br>
Gideon answered him, "If I find favor with you,<br>
give me a sign that you are speaking with me.<br>
Do not depart from here, I pray you, until I come back to you<br>
and bring out my offering and set it before you."<br>
He answered, "I will await your return."<br><br>

So Gideon went off and prepared a kid and a measure of flour<br>
in the form of unleavened cakes.<br>
Putting the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot,<br>
he brought them out to him under the terebinth<br>
and presented them.<br>
The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and unleavened cakes<br>
and lay them on this rock; then pour out the broth."<br>
When he had done so,<br>
the angel of the LORD stretched out the tip of the staff he held,<br>
and touched the meat and unleavened cakes.<br>
Thereupon a fire came up from the rock<br>
that consumed the meat and unleavened cakes,<br>
and the angel of the LORD disappeared from sight.<br>
Gideon, now aware that it had been the angel of the LORD,<br>
said, "Alas, Lord GOD,<br>
that I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!"<br>
The LORD answered him,<br>
"Be calm, do not fear. You shall not die."<br>
So Gideon built there an altar to the LORD<br>
and called it Yahweh-shalom.</td>

"The Kingdom of heaven is like a landowner<br>
who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard.<br>
After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage,<br>
he sent them into his vineyard.<br>
Going out about nine o'clock,<br>
he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,<br>
and he said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard,<br>
and I will give you what is just.'<br>
So they went off.<br>
And he went out again around noon,<br>
and around three o'clock, and did likewise.<br>
Going out about five o'clock,<br>
he found others standing around, and said to them,<br>
'Why do you stand here idle all day?'<br>
They answered, 'Because no one has hired us.'<br>
He said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard.'<br>
When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman,<br>
'Summon the laborers and give them their pay,<br>
beginning with the last and ending with the first.'<br>
When those who had started about five o'clock came,<br>
each received the usual daily wage.<br>
So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more,<br>
but each of them also got the usual wage.<br>
And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner, saying,<br>
'These last ones worked only one hour,<br>
and you have made them equal to us,<br>
who bore the day's burden and the heat.'<br>
He said to one of them in reply,<br>
'My friend, I am not cheating you.
Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?<br>
Take what is yours and go.<br>
What if I wish to give this last one the same as you?<br>
Or am I not free to do as I wish with my own money?<br>
Are you envious because I am generous?'<br>
Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last."

The king was deeply distressed,<br>
but because of his oaths and the guests<br>
he did not wish to break his word to her.<br>
So he promptly dispatched an executioner with orders<br>
to bring back his head.<br>
He went off and beheaded him in the prison.<br>
He brought in the head on a platter and gave it to the girl.<br>
The girl in turn gave it to her mother.<br>
When his disciples heard about it,<br>
they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
