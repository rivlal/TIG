and how no desire that his heart conceived<br>
was ever anything but evil<br>
he regretted that he had made man on the earth,<br>
and his heart was grieved.<br><br>

So the LORD said:<br>
"I will wipe out from the earth the men whom I have created,<br>
and not only the men,<br>
but also the beasts and the creeping things and the birds of the air,<br>
for I am sorry that I made them."<br>
But Noah found favor with the LORD.<br><br>

Then the LORD said to Noah:<br>
"Go into the ark, you and all your household,<br>
for you alone in this age have I found to be truly just.<br>
Of every clean animal, take with you seven pairs,<br>
a male and its mate;<br>
and of the unclean animals, one pair,<br>
a male and its mate;<br>
likewise, of every clean bird of the air, seven pairs,<br>
a male and a female,<br>
and of all the unclean birds, one pair,<br>
a male and a female.<br>
Thus you will keep their issue alive over all the earth.<br>
Seven days from now I will bring rain down on the earth<br>
for forty days and forty nights,<br>
and so I will wipe out from the surface of the earth<br>
every moving creature that I have made."<br>
Noah did just as the LORD had commanded him.<br><br>

the waters of the flood came upon the earth.</td>

and he sent out a raven,<br>
to see if the waters had lessened on the earth.<br>
It flew back and forth until the waters dried off from the earth.<br>
Then he sent out a dove,<br>
to see if the waters had lessened on the earth.<br>
But the dove could find no place to alight and perch,<br>
and it returned to him in the ark,<br>
for there was water all over the earth.<br>
Putting out his hand, he caught the dove<br>
and drew it back to him inside the ark.<br>
He waited seven days more and again sent the dove out from the ark.<br>
In the evening the dove came back to him,<br>
and there in its bill was a plucked-off olive leaf!<br>
So Noah knew that the waters had lessened on the earth.<br>
He waited still another seven days<br>
and then released the dove once more;<br>
and this time it did not come back.<br><br>

In the six hundred and first year of Noah’s life,<br>
in the first month, on the first day of the month,<br>
the water began to dry up on the earth.<br>
Noah then removed the covering of the ark<br>
and saw that the surface of the ground was drying up.<br><br>

Noah built an altar to the LORD,<br>
and choosing from every clean animal and every clean bird,<br>
he offered burnt offerings on the altar.<br>
When the LORD smelled the sweet odor, he said to himself:<br>
“Never again will I doom the earth because of man<br>
since the desires of man’s heart are evil from the start;<br>
nor will I ever again strike down all living beings, as I have done.<br>

I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable to do so.”<br>

“O faithless generation, how long will I be with you?<br>
How long will I endure you? Bring him to me.”<br>

the spirit immediately threw the boy into convulsions.<br>

“How long has this been happening to him?”<br>
He replied, “Since childhood.<br>
It has often thrown him into fire and into water to kill him.<br>
But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”<br>
Jesus said to him,<br>
“‘If you can!’ Everything is possible to one who has faith.”<br>
Then the boy’s father cried out, “I do believe, help my unbelief!”<br>
Jesus, on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering,<br>
rebuked the unclean spirit and said to it,<br>
“Mute and deaf spirit, I command you:<br>
come out of him and never enter him again!”<br>
Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions, it came out.<br>
He became like a corpse, which caused many to say, “He is dead!”<br>
But Jesus took him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.<br>
When he entered the house, his disciples asked him in private,<br>
“Why could we not drive the spirit out?”<br>
He said to them, “This kind can only come out through prayer.”</td>
