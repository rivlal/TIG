I will deliver them from all their sins of apostasy,<br>

            <td class="aceem">Many of the Jews who had come to Mary<br>
and seen what Jesus had done began to believe in him.<br>
But some of them went to the Pharisees<br>
and told them what Jesus had done.<br>
So the chief priests and the Pharisees<br>
convened the Sanhedrin and said,<br>
"What are we going to do?<br>
This man is performing many signs.<br>
If we leave him alone, all will believe in him,<br>
and the Romans will come<br>
and take away both our land and our nation."<br>
But one of them, Caiaphas,<br>
who was high priest that year, said to them,<br>
"You know nothing,<br>
nor do you consider that it is better for you<br>
that one man should die instead of the people,<br>
so that the whole nation may not perish."<br>
He did not say this on his own,<br>
but since he was high priest for that year,<br>
he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,<br>
and not only for the nation,<br>
but also to gather into one the dispersed children of God.<br>
So from that day on they planned to kill him.<br><br>

So Jesus no longer walked about in public among the Jews,<br>
but he left for the region near the desert,<br>
to a town called Ephraim,<br>
and there he remained with his disciples.<br><br>

Now the Passover of the Jews was near,<br>
and many went up from the country to Jerusalem<br>
before Passover to purify themselves.<br>
They looked for Jesus and said to one another<br>
as they were in the temple area, "What do you think?<br>
That he will not come to the feast?"

Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them,<br>
"Go into the village opposite you,<br>

and a colt with her.<br>
Untie them and bring them here to me.<br>
And if anyone should say anything to you, reply,<br>
'The master has need of them.'<br>
Then he will send them at once."<br>
This happened so that what had been spoken through the prophet
might be fulfilled:<br>
<i>Say to daughter Zion,<br>
"Behold, your king comes to you,<br>
meek and riding on an ass,<br>
    and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden."</i><br>
The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them.<br>
They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks over them,<br>
and he sat upon them.<br>
The very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,<br>
while others cut branches from the trees<br>
and strewed them on the road.<br>
The crowds preceding him and those following<br>
kept crying out and saying:<br>
"Hosanna to the Son of David;<br>
blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord;<br>
hosanna in the highest."<br>
And when he entered Jerusalem<br>
the whole city was shaken and asked, "Who is this?"<br>
And the crowds replied,<br>
"This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee."</td>

            <td class="aceem">One of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot,<br>
went to the chief priests and said,<br>
"What are you willing to give me<br>
if I hand him over to you?"<br>
They paid him thirty pieces of silver,<br>
and from that time on he looked for an opportunity<br>
to hand him over.<br><br>

On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<br>
the disciples approached Jesus and said,<br>
"Where do you want us to prepare<br>
for you to eat the Passover?"<br>
He said,<br>
"Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,<br>
'The teacher says, "My appointed time draws near;<br>
in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples."'"<br>
The disciples then did as Jesus had ordered,<br>
and prepared the Passover.<br>

When it was evening,<br>
he reclined at table with the Twelve.<br>
And while they were eating, he said,<br>
"Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me."<br>
Deeply distressed at this,<br>
they began to say to him one after another,<br>
"Surely it is not I, Lord?"<br>
He said in reply,<br>
"He who has dipped his hand into the dish with me<br>
is the one who will betray me.<br>
The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him,<br>
but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.<br>
It would be better for that man if he had never been born."<br>
Then Judas, his betrayer, said in reply,<br>
"Surely it is not I, Rabbi?"<br>
He answered, "You have said so."<br><br>

While they were eating,<br>
Jesus took bread, said the blessing,<br>
broke it, and giving it to his disciples said,<br>
"Take and eat; this is my body."<br>
Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,<br>
"Drink from it, all of you,<br>
for this is my blood of the covenant,<br>
which will be shed on behalf of many<br>
for the forgiveness of sins.<br>
I tell you, from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine<br>
until the day when I drink it with you new<br>
in the kingdom of my Father."<br>
Then, after singing a hymn,<br>
they went out to the Mount of Olives.<br><br>

Then Jesus said to them,<br>
"This night all of you will have your faith in me shaken,<br>
for it is written:<br>
I will strike the shepherd,<br>
and the sheep of the flock will be dispersed;<br>
but after I have been raised up,<br>
I shall go before you to Galilee."<br>
Peter said to him in reply,<br>
"Though all may have their faith in you shaken,<br>
mine will never be."<br>
Jesus said to him,<br>
"Amen, I say to you,<br>
this very night before the cock crows,<br>
you will deny me three times."<br>
Peter said to him,<br>
"Even though I should have to die with you,<br>
I will not deny you."<br>
And all the disciples spoke likewise.<br><br>

Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,<br>
and he said to his disciples,<br>
"Sit here while I go over there and pray."<br>
He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,<br>
and began to feel sorrow and distress.<br>
Then he said to them,<br>
"My soul is sorrowful even to death.<br>
Remain here and keep watch with me."<br>
He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying,<br>
"My Father, if it is possible,<br>
let this cup pass from me;<br>
yet, not as I will, but as you will."<br>
When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep.<br>
He said to Peter,<br>
"So you could not keep watch with me for one hour?<br>
Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test.<br>
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."<br>
Withdrawing a second time, he prayed again,<br>
"My Father, if it is not possible that this cup pass<br>
without my drinking it, your will be done!"<br>
Then he returned once more and found them asleep,<br>
for they could not keep their eyes open.<br>
He left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time,<br>
saying the same thing again.<br>
Then he returned to his disciples and said to them,<br>
"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest?<br>
Behold, the hour is at hand<br>
when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.<br>
Get up, let us go.<br>
Look, my betrayer is at hand."<br><br>

While he was still speaking,<br>
Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived,<br>
accompanied by a large crowd, with swords and clubs,<br>
who had come from the chief priests and the elders<br>
of the people.<br>
His betrayer had arranged a sign with them, saying,<br>
"The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him."<br>
Immediately he went over to Jesus and said,<br>
"Hail, Rabbi!" and he kissed him.<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>
"Friend, do what you have come for."<br>
Then stepping forward they laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.<br>
And behold, one of those who accompanied Jesus<br>
put his hand to his sword, drew it,<br>
and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.<br>
Then Jesus said to him,<br>
"Put your sword back into its sheath,<br>
for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.<br>
Do you think that I cannot call upon my Father<br>
and he will not provide me at this moment<br>
with more than twelve legions of angels?<br>
But then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled<br>
which say that it must come to pass in this way?"<br>
At that hour Jesus said to the crowds,<br>
"Have you come out as against a robber,<br>
with swords and clubs to seize me?<br>
Day after day I sat teaching in the temple area,<br>
yet you did not arrest me.<br>
But all this has come to pass<br>
that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled."<br>
Then all the disciples left him and fled.<br><br>

Those who had arrested Jesus led him away<br>
to Caiaphas the high priest,<br>
where the scribes and the elders were assembled.<br>
Peter was following him at a distance<br>
as far as the high priest's courtyard,<br>
and going inside he sat down with the servants<br>
to see the outcome.<br>
The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin<br>
kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus<br>
in order to put him to death,<br>
but they found none,<br>
though many false witnesses came forward.<br>
Finally two came forward who stated,<br>
"This man said, 'I can destroy the temple of God<br>
and within three days rebuild it.'"<br>
The high priest rose and addressed him,<br>
"Have you no answer?<br>
What are these men testifying against you?"<br>
But Jesus was silent.<br>
Then the high priest said to him,<br>
"I order you to tell us under oath before the living God<br>
whether you are the Christ, the Son of God."<br>
Jesus said to him in reply,<br>
"You have said so.<br>
But I tell you:<br>
From now on you will see 'the Son of Man<br>
seated at the right hand of the Power'<br>
and 'coming on the clouds of heaven.'"<br>
Then the high priest tore his robes and said,<br>
"He has blasphemed!<br>
What further need have we of witnesses?<br>
You have now heard the blasphemy;<br>
what is your opinion?"<br>
They said in reply,<br>
"He deserves to die!"<br>
Then they spat in his face and struck him,<br>
while some slapped him, saying,<br>
"Prophesy for us, Christ: who is it that struck you?"<br><br>

Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.<br>
One of the maids came over to him and said,<br>
"You too were with Jesus the Galilean."<br>
But he denied it in front of everyone, saying,<br>
"I do not know what you are talking about!"<br>
As he went out to the gate, another girl saw him<br>
and said to those who were there,<br>
"This man was with Jesus the Nazorean."<br>
Again he denied it with an oath,<br>
"I do not know the man!"<br>
A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter,<br>
"Surely you too are one of them;<br>
even your speech gives you away."<br>
At that he began to curse and to swear,<br>
"I do not know the man."<br>
And immediately a cock crowed.<br>
Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken:<br>
"Before the cock crows you will deny me three times."<br>
He went out and began to weep bitterly.<br><br>

When it was morning,<br>
all the chief priests and the elders of the people<br>
took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.<br>
They bound him, led him away,<br>
and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.<br><br>

Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned,<br>
deeply regretted what he had done.<br>
He returned the thirty pieces of silver<br>
to the chief priests and elders, saying,<br>
"I have sinned in betraying innocent blood."<br>
They said,<br>
"What is that to us?<br>
Look to it yourself."<br>
Flinging the money into the temple,<br>
he departed and went off and hanged himself.<br>
The chief priests gathered up the money, but said,<br>
"It is not lawful to deposit this in the temple treasury,<br>
for it is the price of blood."<br>
After consultation, they used it to buy the potter's field<br>
as a burial place for foreigners.<br>
That is why that field even today is called the Field of Blood.<br>
Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah
the prophet,<br>
And they took the thirty pieces of silver,<br>
the value of a man with a price on his head,<br>
a price set by some of the Israelites,<br>
and they paid it out for the potter's field<br>
just as the Lord had commanded me.<br><br>

Now Jesus stood before the governor, and he questioned him,<br>
"Are you the king of the Jews?"<br>
Jesus said, "You say so."<br>
And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders,<br>
he made no answer.<br>
Then Pilate said to him,<br>
"Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?"<br>
But he did not answer him one word,<br>
so that the governor was greatly amazed.<br><br>

Now on the occasion of the feast<br>
the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd<br>
one prisoner whom they wished.<br>
And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.<br>
So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them,<br>
"Which one do you want me to release to you,<br>
Barabbas, or Jesus called Christ?"<br>
For he knew that it was out of envy<br>
that they had handed him over.<br>
While he was still seated on the bench,<br>
his wife sent him a message,<br>
"Have nothing to do with that righteous man.<br>
I suffered much in a dream today because of him."<br>
The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds<br>
to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus.<br>
The governor said to them in reply,<br>
"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?"<br>
They answered, "Barabbas!"<br>
Pilate said to them,<br>
"Then what shall I do with Jesus called Christ?"<br>
They all said,<br>
"Let him be crucified!"<br>
But he said,<br>
"Why? What evil has he done?"<br>
They only shouted the louder,<br>
"Let him be crucified!"<br>
When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all,<br>
but that a riot was breaking out instead,<br>
he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd,<br>
saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood.<br>
Look to it yourselves."<br>
And the whole people said in reply,<br>
"His blood be upon us and upon our children."<br>
Then he released Barabbas to them,<br>
but after he had Jesus scourged,<br>
he handed him over to be crucified.<br><br>

Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium<br>
and gathered the whole cohort around him.<br>
They stripped off his clothes<br>
and threw a scarlet military cloak about him.<br>
Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head,<br>
and a reed in his right hand.<br>
And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying,<br>
"Hail, King of the Jews!"<br>
They spat upon him and took the reed<br>
and kept striking him on the head.<br>
And when they had mocked him,<br>
they stripped him of the cloak,<br>
dressed him in his own clothes,<br>
and led him off to crucify him.<br><br>

As they were going out, they met a Cyrenian named Simon;<br>
this man they pressed into service<br>
to carry his cross.<br><br>

And when they came to a place called Golgotha<br>
—which means Place of the Skull —,<br>
they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall.<br>
But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink.<br>
After they had crucified him,<br>
they divided his garments by casting lots;<br>
then they sat down and kept watch over him there.<br>
And they placed over his head the written charge against him:<br>
This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.<br>
Two revolutionaries were crucified with him,<br>
one on his right and the other on his left.<br>
Those passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying,<br>
"You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,<br>
save yourself, if you are the Son of God,<br>
and come down from the cross!"<br>
Likewise the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him and said,<br>
"He saved others; he cannot save himself.<br>
So he is the king of Israel!<br>
Let him come down from the cross now,<br>
and we will believe in him.<br>
He trusted in God;<br>
let him deliver him now if he wants him.<br>
For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"<br>
The revolutionaries who were crucified with him<br>
also kept abusing him in the same way.<br><br>

From noon onward, darkness came over the whole land<br>
until three in the afternoon.<br>
And about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,<br>
"Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?"<br>
which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"<br>
Some of the bystanders who heard it said,<br>
"This one is calling for Elijah."<br>
Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge;<br>
he soaked it in wine, and putting it on a reed,<br>
gave it to him to drink.<br>
But the rest said,<br>
"Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him."<br>
But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice,<br>
and gave up his spirit.<br><br>

(Here all kneel and pause for a short time.)<br><br>

And behold, the veil of the sanctuary<br>
was torn in two from top to bottom.<br>
The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened,<br>
and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.<br>
And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection,<br>
they entered the holy city and appeared to many.<br>
The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus<br>
feared greatly when they saw the earthquake<br>
and all that was happening, and they said,<br>
"Truly, this was the Son of God!"<br>
There were many women there, looking on from a distance,<br>
who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him.<br>
Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph,<br>
and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.<br><br>

When it was evening,<br>
there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph,<br>
who was himself a disciple of Jesus.<br>
He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus;<br>
then Pilate ordered it to be handed over.<br>
Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen<br>
and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock.<br>
Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb
and departed.<br>
But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary<br>
remained sitting there, facing the tomb.<br><br>

The next day, the one following the day of preparation,<br>
the chief priests and the Pharisees<br>
gathered before Pilate and said,<br>
"Sir, we remember that this impostor while still alive said,<br>
'After three days I will be raised up.'<br>
Give orders, then, that the grave be secured until the third day,<br>
lest his disciples come and steal him and say to the people,<br>
'He has been raised from the dead.'<br>
This last imposture would be worse than the first."<br>
Pilate said to them,<br>
"The guard is yours;<br>
go, secure it as best you can."<br>
So they went and secured the tomb<br>
by fixing a seal to the stone and setting the guard.

Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oil<br>

So Jesus said, "Leave her alone.<br>
Let her keep this for the day of my burial.<br>

The large crowd of the Jews found out that he was there and came,<br>
not only because of him, but also to see Lazarus,<br>
whom he had raised from the dead.<br>
And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,<br>
because many of the Jews were turning away<br>
and believing in Jesus because of him.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Reclining at table with his disciples, Jesus was deeply troubled and testified,<br>
"Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me."<br>
The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he meant.<br>
One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved,<br>
was reclining at Jesus' side.<br>
So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom he meant.<br>
He leaned back against Jesus' chest and said to him,<br>
"Master, who is it?"<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
"It is the one to whom I hand the morsel after I have dipped it."<br>
So he dipped the morsel and took it and handed it to Judas,<br>
son of Simon the Iscariot.<br>
After Judas took the morsel, Satan entered him.<br>
So Jesus said to him, "What you are going to do, do quickly."<br>
Now none of those reclining at table realized why he said this to him.<br>
Some thought that since Judas kept the money bag, Jesus had told him,<br>
"Buy what we need for the feast,"<br>
or to give something to the poor.<br>
So Judas took the morsel and left at once. And it was night.<br><br>

When he had left, Jesus said,<br>
"Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<br>
If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself,<br>
and he will glorify him at once.<br>
My children, I will be with you only a little while longer.<br>
You will look for me, and as I told the Jews,<br>
'Where I go you cannot come,' so now I say it to you."<br><br>

Simon Peter said to him, "Master, where are you going?"<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>
"Where I am going, you cannot follow me now,<br>
though you will follow later."<br>
Peter said to him,<br>
"Master, why can I not follow you now?<br>
I will lay down my life for you."<br>
Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me?<br>
Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow<br>
before you deny me three times."</td>

Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet.”<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>

Jesus said to him,<br>

so you are clean, but not all.”<br>

Rolling up the scroll, he handed it back to the attendant and sat down,<br>

He said to them,<br>
“Today this Scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.”

Even as many were amazed at him --<br>
    so marred was his look beyond human semblance<br>
    and his appearance beyond that of the sons of man--<br>
so shall he startle many nations,<br>
    because of him kings shall stand speechless;<br>
for those who have not been told shall see,<br>
    those who have not heard shall ponder it.<br><br>

Who would believe what we have heard?<br>
    To whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?<br>
He grew up like a sapling before him,<br>
    like a shoot from the parched earth;<br>
there was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him,<br>
    nor appearance that would attract us to him.<br>
He was spurned and avoided by people,<br>
    a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity,<br>
one of those from whom people hide their faces,<br>
    spurned, and we held him in no esteem.<br><br>

Yet it was our infirmities that he bore,<br>
    our sufferings that he endured,<br>
while we thought of him as stricken,<br>
    as one smitten by God and afflicted.<br>
But he was pierced for our offenses,<br>
    crushed for our sins;<br>
upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole,<br>
    by his stripes we were healed.<br>
We had all gone astray like sheep,<br>
    each following his own way;<br>
but the LORD laid upon him<br>
    the guilt of us all.<br><br>

Though he was harshly treated, he submitted<br>
    and opened not his mouth;<br>
like a lamb led to the slaughter<br>
    or a sheep before the shearers,<br>
    he was silent and opened not his mouth.<br>
Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away,<br>
    and who would have thought any more of his destiny?<br>
When he was cut off from the land of the living,<br>
    and smitten for the sin of his people,<br>
a grave was assigned him among the wicked<br>
    and a burial place with evildoers,<br>
though he had done no wrong<br>
    nor spoken any falsehood.<br>
But the LORD was pleased<br>
    to crush him in infirmity.<br><br>

If he gives his life as an offering for sin,<br>
    he shall see his descendants in a long life,<br>
    and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.<br><br>

Because of his affliction<br>
    he shall see the light in fullness of days;<br>
through his suffering, my servant shall justify many,<br>
    and their guilt he shall bear.<br>
Therefore I will give him his portion among the great,<br>
    and he shall divide the spoils with the mighty,<br>
because he surrendered himself to death<br>
    and was counted among the wicked;<br>
and he shall take away the sins of many,<br>
    and win pardon for their offenses.</td>

to the one who was able to save him from death, <br>

            <td class="aceem">Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley <br>
to where there was a garden, <br>
into which he and his disciples entered.<br>
Judas his betrayer also knew the place, <br>
because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.<br>
So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards <br>
from the chief priests and the Pharisees <br>
and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.<br>
Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, <br>
went out and said to them, “Whom are you looking for?”<br>
They answered him, “Jesus the Nazorean.”<br>
He said to them, “I AM.”<br>
Judas his betrayer was also with them.<br>
When he said to them, “I AM, “ <br>
they turned away and fell to the ground.<br>
So he again asked them,<br>
“Whom are you looking for?”<br>
They said, “Jesus the Nazorean.”<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
“I told you that I AM.<br>
So if you are looking for me, let these men go.”<br>
This was to fulfill what he had said, <br>
“I have not lost any of those you gave me.”<br>
Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, <br>
struck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear.<br>
The slave’s name was Malchus.<br>
Jesus said to Peter,<br>
“Put your sword into its scabbard.<br>
Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?”<br><br>

So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus,<br>
bound him, and brought him to Annas first.<br>
He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, <br>
who was high priest that year.<br>
It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews <br>
that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.<br><br>

Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus.<br>
Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, <br>
and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.<br>
But Peter stood at the gate outside.<br>
So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, <br>
went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.<br>
Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, <br>
“You are not one of this man’s disciples, are you?”<br>
He said, “I am not.”<br>
Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire<br>
that they had made, because it was cold,<br>
and were warming themselves.<br>
Peter was also standing there keeping warm.<br><br>

The high priest questioned Jesus <br>
about his disciples and about his doctrine.<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>
“I have spoken publicly to the world.<br>
I have always taught in a synagogue <br>
or in the temple area where all the Jews gather, <br>
and in secret I have said nothing.  Why ask me?<br>
Ask those who heard me what I said to them.<br>
They know what I said.”<br>
When he had said this, <br>
one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, <br>
“Is this the way you answer the high priest?”<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>
“If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; <br>
but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?”<br>
Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.<br><br>

Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm.<br>
And they said to him,<br>
“You are not one of his disciples, are you?”<br>
He denied it and said,<br>
“I am not.”<br>
One of the slaves of the high priest, <br>
a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, <br>
“Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”<br>
Again Peter denied it.<br>
And immediately the cock crowed.<br><br>

Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium.<br>
It was morning.<br>
And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, <br>
in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.<br>
So Pilate came out to them and said, <br>
“What charge do you bring against this man?”<br>
They answered and said to him,<br>
“If he were not a criminal, <br>
we would not have handed him over to you.”<br>
At this, Pilate said to them, <br>
“Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”<br>
The Jews answered him, <br>
“We do not have the right to execute anyone,“ <br>
in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled<br>
that he said indicating the kind of death he would die.<br>
So Pilate went back into the praetorium <br>
and summoned Jesus and said to him, <br>
“Are you the King of the Jews?”<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
“Do you say this on your own <br>
or have others told you about me?”<br>
Pilate answered,<br>
“I am not a Jew, am I?<br>
Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.<br>
What have you done?”<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
“My kingdom does not belong to this world.<br>
If my kingdom did belong to this world, <br>
my attendants would be fighting <br>
to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.<br>
But as it is, my kingdom is not here.”<br>
So Pilate said to him,<br>
“Then you are a king?”<br>
Jesus answered,<br>
“You say I am a king.<br>
For this I was born and for this I came into the world, <br>
to testify to the truth.<br>
Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”<br>
Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”<br><br>

When he had said this,<br>
he again went out to the Jews and said to them,<br>
“I find no guilt in him.<br>
But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover.<br>
Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”<br>
They cried out again,<br>
“Not this one but Barabbas!”<br>
Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.<br><br>

Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.<br>
And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, <br>
and clothed him in a purple cloak, <br>
and they came to him and said,<br>
“Hail, King of the Jews!”<br>
And they struck him repeatedly.<br>
Once more Pilate went out and said to them, <br>
“Look, I am bringing him out to you, <br>
so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.”<br>
So Jesus came out, <br>
wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.<br>
And he said to them, “Behold, the man!”<br>
When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, <br>
“Crucify him, crucify him!”<br><br>

Pilate said to them,<br>
“Take him yourselves and crucify him.<br>
I find no guilt in him.”<br>
The Jews answered, <br>
“We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, <br>
because he made himself the Son of God.”<br>
Now when Pilate heard this statement,<br>
he became even more afraid, <br>
and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, <br>
“Where are you from?”<br>
Jesus did not answer him.<br>
So Pilate said to him,<br>
“Do you not speak to me?<br>
Do you not know that I have power to release you <br>
and I have power to crucify you?”<br>
Jesus answered him,<br>
“You would have no power over me <br>
if it had not been given to you from above.<br>
For this reason the one who handed me over to you<br>
has the greater sin.”<br>
Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, <br>
“If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar.<br>
Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”<br><br>

When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out <br>
and seated him on the judge’s bench <br>
in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.<br>
It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon.<br>
And he said to the Jews,<br>
“Behold, your king!”<br>
They cried out,<br>
“Take him away, take him away!  Crucify him!”<br>
Pilate said to them,<br>
“Shall I crucify your king?”<br>
The chief priests answered,<br>
“We have no king but Caesar.”<br>
Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.<br><br>

So they took Jesus, and, carrying the cross himself, <br>
he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull,<br> 
in Hebrew, Golgotha.<br>
There they crucified him, and with him two others, <br>
one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.<br>
Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross.<br>
It read,<br>
“Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.”<br>
Now many of the Jews read this inscription, <br>
because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; <br>
and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.<br>
So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, <br>
“Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’<br>
but that he said, ‘I am the King of the Jews’.”<br>
Pilate answered,<br>
“What I have written, I have written.”<br><br>

When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, <br>
they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, <br>
a share for each soldier.<br>
They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, <br>
woven in one piece from the top down.<br>
So they said to one another, <br>
“Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be, “ <br>
in order that the passage of Scripture might be fulfilled that says:<br>
    They divided my garments among them,<br>
        and for my vesture they cast lots.<br>
This is what the soldiers did.<br>
Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother<br>
and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,<br>
and Mary of Magdala.<br>
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved<br>
he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.”<br>
Then he said to the disciple,<br>
“Behold, your mother.”<br>
And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br><br>

After this, aware that everything was now finished, <br>
in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <br>
Jesus said, “I thirst.”<br>
There was a vessel filled with common wine.<br>
So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop <br>
and put it up to his mouth.<br>
When Jesus had taken the wine, he said,<br>
“It is finished.”<br>
And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.<br><br>

        (Here all kneel and pause for a short time.)<br><br>

Now since it was preparation day,<br>
in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,<br>
for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, <br>
the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken <br>
and that they be taken down.<br>
So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first <br>
and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.<br>
But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, <br>
they did not break his legs, <br>
but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, <br>
and immediately blood and water flowed out.<br>
An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; <br>
he knows that he is speaking the truth, <br>
so that you also may come to believe.<br>
For this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:<br>
    Not a bone of it will be broken.<br>
And again another passage says:<br>
    They will look upon him whom they have pierced.<br><br>

After this, Joseph of Arimathea, <br>
secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, <br>
asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus.<br>
And Pilate permitted it.<br>
So he came and took his body.<br>
Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, <br>
also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes <br>
weighing about one hundred pounds.<br>
They took the body of Jesus <br>
and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, <br>
according to the Jewish burial custom.<br>
Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, <br>
and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.<br>
So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; <br>
for the tomb was close by.</td>

Then God said,<br>

God saw how good the light was.<br>
God then separated the light from the darkness.<br>
God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night."<br>
Thus evening came, and morning followed—the first day.<br><br>

Let them mark the fixed times, the days and the years,<br>
and serve as luminaries in the dome of the sky,<br>

Evening came, and morning followed—the fourth day.<br><br>

Then God said,<br>
"Let the water teem with an abundance of living creatures,<br>
and on the earth let birds fly beneath the dome of the sky."<br>
And so it happened:<br>
God created the great sea monsters<br>
and all kinds of swimming creatures with which the water teems,<br>
and all kinds of winged birds.<br>
God saw how good it was, and God blessed them, saying,<br>
"Be fertile, multiply, and fill the water of the seas;<br>
and let the birds multiply on the earth."<br>
Evening came, and morning followed—the fifth day.<br><br>

Then God said,<br>
"Let the earth bring forth all kinds of living creatures:<br>
cattle, creeping things, and wild animals of all kinds."<br>
And so it happened:<br>
God made all kinds of wild animals, all kinds of cattle,<br>
and all kinds of creeping things of the earth.<br>
God saw how good it was.<br>
Then God said:<br>
"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.<br>
Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,<br>
the birds of the air, and the cattle,<br>
and over all the wild animals<br>
and all the creatures that crawl on the ground."<br>
God created man in his image;<br>
in the image of God he created him;<br>
male and female he created them.<br>
God blessed them, saying:<br>
"Be fertile and multiply;<br>
fill the earth and subdue it.<br>
Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air,<br>
and all the living things that move on the earth."<br>
God also said:<br>
"See, I give you every seed-bearing plant all over the earth<br>
and every tree that has seed-bearing fruit on it to be your food;<br>
and to all the animals of the land, all the birds of the air,<br>
and all the living creatures that crawl on the ground,<br>
I give all the green plants for food."<br>
And so it happened.<br>
God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good.<br>
Evening came, and morning followed—the sixth day.<br>
Thus the heavens and the earth and all their array were completed.<br>
Since on the seventh day God was finished<br>
with the work he had been doing,<br>
he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had undertaken.</td>

            <td class="aceem">God put Abraham to the test.<br>
He called to him, "Abraham!"<br>
"Here I am,"  he replied.<br>
Then God said:<br>
"Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love,<br>
and go to the land of Moriah.<br>
There you shall offer him up as a holocaust<br>
on a height that I will point out to you."<br>
Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey,<br>
took with him his son Isaac and two of his servants as well,<br>
and with the wood that he had cut for the holocaust,<br>
set out for the place of which God had told him.<br><br>

On the third day Abraham got sight of the place from afar.<br>
Then he said to his servants:<br>
"Both of you stay here with the donkey,<br>
while the boy and I go on over yonder.<br>
We will worship and then come back to you."<br>
Thereupon Abraham took the wood for the holocaust<br>
and laid it on his son Isaac's shoulders,<br>
while he himself carried the fire and the knife.<br>
As the two walked on together, Isaac spoke to his father Abraham:<br>
"Father!" Isaac said.<br>
"Yes, son," he replied.<br>
Isaac continued, "Here are the fire and the wood,<br>
but where is the sheep for the holocaust?"<br>
"Son," Abraham answered,<br>
"God himself will provide the sheep for the holocaust."<br>
Then the two continued going forward.<br><br>

When they came to the place of which God had told him,<br>
Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it.<br>
Next he tied up his son Isaac,<br>
and put him on top of the wood on the altar.<br>
Then he reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.<br>
But the LORD's messenger called to him from heaven,<br>
"Abraham, Abraham!"<br>
"Here I am!" he answered.<br>
"Do not lay your hand on the boy," said the messenger.<br>
"Do not do the least thing to him.<br>
I know now how devoted you are to God,<br>
since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son."<br>
As Abraham looked about,<br>
he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket.<br>
So he went and took the ram<br>
and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.<br>
Abraham named the site Yahweh-yireh;<br>
hence people now say, "On the mountain the LORD will see."<br><br>

Again the LORD's messenger called to Abraham from heaven and said:<br>
"I swear by myself, declares the LORD,<br>
that because you acted as you did<br>
in not withholding from me your beloved son,<br>
I will bless you abundantly<br>
and make your descendants as countless<br>
as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore;<br>
your descendants shall take possession<br>
of the gates of their enemies,<br>
and in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing--<br>

Tell the Israelites to go forward.<br>
And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea,<br>
split the sea in two,<br>
that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land.<br>
But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate<br>
that they will go in after them.<br>
Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army,<br>
his chariots and charioteers.<br>
The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD,<br>
when I receive glory through Pharaoh<br>
and his chariots and charioteers."<br><br>

The angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp,<br>
now moved and went around behind them.<br>
The column of cloud also, leaving the front,<br>
took up its place behind them,<br>
so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians<br>
and that of Israel.<br>
But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed<br>
without the rival camps coming any closer together<br>
all night long.<br>
Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,<br>
and the LORD swept the sea<br>
with a strong east wind throughout the night<br>
and so turned it into dry land.<br>
When the water was thus divided,<br>
the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land,<br>
with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br><br>

The Egyptians followed in pursuit;<br>
all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them<br>
right into the midst of the sea.<br>
In the night watch just before dawn<br>
the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud<br>
upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic;<br>
and he so clogged their chariot wheels<br>
that they could hardly drive.<br>
With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel,<br>
because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.<br><br>

Then the LORD told Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea,<br>
that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians,<br>
upon their chariots and their charioteers."<br>
So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,<br>
and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth.<br>
The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea,<br>
when the LORD hurled them into its midst.<br>
As the water flowed back,<br>
it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army<br>
which had followed the Israelites into the sea.<br>
Not a single one of them escaped.<br>
But the Israelites had marched on dry land<br>
through the midst of the sea,<br>
with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br>
Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day<br>
from the power of the Egyptians.<br>
When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore<br>
and beheld the great power that the LORD<br>
had shown against the Egyptians,<br>
they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his servant Moses.<br><br>

Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD:<br>

so that our sinful body might be done away with,<br>
that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.<br>
For a dead person has been absolved from sin.<br>
If, then, we have died with Christ,<br>
we believe that we shall also live with him.<br>
We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more;<br>
death no longer has power over him.<br>
As to his death, he died to sin once and for all;<br>
as to his life, he lives for God.<br>
Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as being dead to sin<br>
and living for God in Christ Jesus.</td>

raised his voice, and proclaimed:<br>
“You who are Jews, indeed all of you staying in Jerusalem.<br>

“You who are children of Israel, hear these words.<br>
Jesus the Nazorean was a man commended to you by God<br>
with mighty deeds, wonders, and signs,<br>
which God worked through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.<br>
This man, delivered up by the set plan and foreknowledge of God,<br>
you killed, using lawless men to crucify him.<br>
But God raised him up, releasing him from the throes of death,<br>
because it was impossible for him to be held by it.<br>
For David says of him:<br><br>

<i>I saw the Lord ever before me,<br>
with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.<br>
Therefore my heart has been glad and my tongue has exulted;<br>
my flesh, too, will dwell in hope,<br>

nor will you suffer your holy one to see corruption.<br>
You have made known to me the paths of life;<br>
    you will fill me with joy in your presence.</i><br><br>

My brothers, one can confidently say to you<br>
about the patriarch David that he died and was buried,<br>
and his tomb is in our midst to this day.<br>
But since he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn an oath to him<br>
that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne,<br>
he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ,<br>
that neither was he abandoned to the netherworld<br>
nor did his flesh see corruption.<br>
God raised this Jesus;<br>
of this we are all witnesses.<br>
Exalted at the right hand of God,<br>
he poured forth the promise of the Holy Spirit<br>
that he received from the Father, as you both see and hear.”</td>

two of Jesus’ disciples were going<br>
to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus,<br>
and they were conversing about all the things that had occurred.<br>
And it happened that while they were conversing and debating,<br>
Jesus himself drew near and walked with them,<br>
but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.<br>
He asked them,<br>
“What are you discussing as you walk along?”<br>
They stopped, looking downcast.<br>
One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in reply,<br>
“Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem<br>
who does not know of the things<br>
that have taken place there in these days?”<br>
And he replied to them, “What sort of things?”<br>
They said to him,<br>
“The things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene,<br>
who was a prophet mighty in deed and word<br>
before God and all the people,<br>
how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over<br>
to a sentence of death and crucified him.<br>
But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel;<br>
and besides all this,<br>
it is now the third day since this took place.<br>
Some women from our group, however, have astounded us:<br>
they were at the tomb early in the morning<br>
and did not find his Body;<br>
they came back and reported<br>
that they had indeed seen a vision of angels<br>
who announced that he was alive.<br>
Then some of those with us went to the tomb<br>
and found things just as the women had described,<br>
but him they did not see.”<br>
And he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are!<br>
How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!<br>
Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things<br>
and enter into his glory?”<br>
Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets,<br>
he interpreted to them what referred to him<br>
in all the Scriptures.<br>
As they approached the village to which they were going,<br>
he gave the impression that he was going on farther.<br>
But they urged him, “Stay with us,<br>
for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.”<br>
So he went in to stay with them.<br>
And it happened that, while he was with them at table,<br>
he took bread, said the blessing,<br>
broke it, and gave it to them.<br>
With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him,<br>
but he vanished from their sight.<br>
Then they said to each other,<br>
“Were not our hearts burning within us<br>
while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?”<br>
So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem<br>
where they found gathered together<br>
the Eleven and those with them who were saying,<br>
“The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!”<br>
Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way<br>
and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.

all the people hurried in amazement toward them<br>

When Peter saw this, he addressed the people,<br>

The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,<br>

The author of life you put to death,<br>

And by faith in his name,<br>
this man, whom you see and know, his name has made strong,<br>
and the faith that comes through it<br>
has given him this perfect health,<br>
in the presence of all of you.<br>
Now I know, brothers and sisters,<br>
that you acted out of ignorance, just as your leaders did;<br>
but God has thus brought to fulfillment<br>
what he had announced beforehand<br>
through the mouth of all the prophets,<br>
that his Christ would suffer.<br>
Repent, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be wiped away,<br>
and that the Lord may grant you times of refreshment<br>
and send you the Christ already appointed for you, Jesus,<br>
whom heaven must receive until the times of universal restoration<br>
of which God spoke through the mouth<br>
of his holy prophets from of old.<br>
For Moses said:<br><br>

<i>A prophet like me will the Lord, your God, raise up for you<br>
from among your own kin;<br>
to him you shall listen in all that he may say to you.<br>
Everyone who does not listen to that prophet<br>
    will be cut off from the people.</i>  <br><br>  

“Moreover, all the prophets who spoke,<br>
from Samuel and those afterwards, also announced these days.<br>
You are the children of the prophets<br>
and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors<br>
when he said to Abraham,<br>
                <i>In your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</i><br>
For you first, God raised up his servant and sent him to bless you<br>

He revealed himself in this way.<br>
Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus,<br>
Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,<br>
Zebedee's sons, and two others of his disciples.<br>
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing."<br>
They said to him, "We also will come with you."<br>
So they went out and got into the boat,<br>
but that night they caught nothing.<br>
When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore;<br>
but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.<br>
Jesus said to them, "Children, have you caught anything to eat?"<br>
They answered him, "No."<br>
So he said to them, "Cast the net over the right side of the boat<br>
and you will find something."<br>
So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in<br>
because of the number of fish.<br>
So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord."<br>
When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,<br>
he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad,<br>
and jumped into the sea.<br>
The other disciples came in the boat,<br>
for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards,<br>
dragging the net with the fish.<br>
When they climbed out on shore,<br>
they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread.<br>
Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you just caught."<br>
So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore<br>
full of one hundred fifty-three large fish.<br>
Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.<br>
Jesus said to them, "Come, have breakfast."<br>
And none of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?"<br>
because they realized it was the Lord.<br>
Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them,<br>
and in like manner the fish.<br>
This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples<br>
after being raised from the dead.

Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”<br>
Jesus said to him, “Have you come to believe because you have seen me?<br>
Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”<br><br>

Now, Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples<br>
that are not written in this book.<br>
But these are written that you may come to believe<br>
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,<br>
and that through this belief you may have life in his name.

Nicodemus answered and said to him,<br>
'How can this happen?"<br>
Jesus answered and said to him,<br>
"You are the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this?<br>
Amen, amen, I say to you,<br>
we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen,<br>
but you people do not accept our testimony.<br>
If I tell you about earthly things and you do not believe,<br>
how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?<br>
No one has gone up to heaven<br>
except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man.<br>
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,<br>
so must the Son of Man be lifted up,<br>
so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."</td>

two of Jesus' disciples were going<br>
to a village seven miles from Jerusalem called Emmaus,<br>

who does not know of the things<br>
that have taken place there in these days?"<br>

They said to him,<br>
"The things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene,<br>
who was a prophet mighty in deed and word<br>
before God and all the people,<br>
how our chief priests and rulers both handed him over<br>
to a sentence of death and crucified him.<br>
But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel;<br>
and besides all this,<br>
it is now the third day since this took place.<br>
Some women from our group, however, have astounded us:<br>
they were at the tomb early in the morning<br>
and did not find his body;<br>
they came back and reported<br>
that they had indeed seen a vision of angels<br>
who announced that he was alive.<br>
Then some of those with us went to the tomb<br>
and found things just as the women had described,<br>
but him they did not see."<br>
And he said to them, "Oh, how foolish you are!<br>
How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke!<br>
Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things<br>
and enter into his glory?"<br>
Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets,<br>
he interpreted to them what referred to him<br>
in all the Scriptures.<br>
As they approached the village to which they were going,<br>
he gave the impression that he was going on farther.<br>
But they urged him, "Stay with us,<br>
for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over."<br>
So he went in to stay with them.<br>
And it happened that, while he was with them at table,<br>
he took bread, said the blessing,<br>
broke it, and gave it to them.<br>
With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him,<br>
but he vanished from their sight.<br>
Then they said to each other,<br>
"Were not our hearts burning within us<br>
while he spoke to us on the way and opened the Scriptures to us?"<br>
So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem<br>
where they found gathered together<br>
the eleven and those with them who were saying,<br>
"The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!"<br>
Then the two recounted<br>
what had taken place on the way<br>
and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.</td>

went to the high priest and asked him<br>
for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, that,<br>
if he should find any men or women who belonged to the Way,<br>
he might bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.<br>
On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus,<br>
a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him.<br>
He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,<br>
"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"<br>
He said, "Who are you, sir?"<br>
The reply came, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.<br>
Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do."<br>
The men who were traveling with him stood speechless,<br>
for they heard the voice but could see no one.<br>
Saul got up from the ground,<br>
but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing;<br>
so they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus.<br>
For three days he was unable to see, and he neither ate nor drank.<br><br>

There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias,<br>
and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias."<br>
He answered, "Here I am, Lord."<br>
The Lord said to him, "Get up and go to the street called Straight<br>
and ask at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul.<br>
He is there praying,<br>
and in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias<br>
come in and lay his hands on him,<br>
that he may regain his sight."<br>
But Ananias replied,<br>
"Lord, I have heard from many sources about this man,<br>
what evil things he has done to your holy ones in Jerusalem.<br>
And here he has authority from the chief priests<br>
to imprison all who call upon your name."<br>
But the Lord said to him,<br>
"Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine<br>
to carry my name before Gentiles, kings, and children of Israel,<br>
and I will show him what he will have to suffer for my name."<br>
So Ananias went and entered the house;<br>
laying his hands on him, he said,<br>
"Saul, my brother, the Lord has sent me,<br>
Jesus who appeared to you on the way by which you came,<br>
that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."<br>
Immediately things like scales fell from his eyes<br>
and he regained his sight.<br>
He got up and was baptized,<br>
and when he had eaten, he recovered his strength.<br><br>

He stayed some days with the disciples in Damascus,<br>
and he began at once to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues,<br>
that he is the Son of God.

Since Lydda was near Joppa,<br>
the disciples, hearing that Peter was there,<br>
sent two men to him with the request,<br>
“Please come to us without delay.” <br>
So Peter got up and went with them. <br>
When he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs<br>
where all the widows came to him weeping<br>
and showing him the tunics and cloaks<br>
that Dorcas had made while she was with them. <br>
Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed. <br>
Then he turned to her body and said, “Tabitha, rise up.” <br>
She opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up. <br>
He gave her his hand and raised her up,<br>

raised his voice, and proclaimed:<br>
"Let the whole house of Israel know for certain<br>
that God has made both Lord and Christ,<br>
this Jesus whom you crucified."<br><br>

Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart,<br>
and they asked Peter and the other apostles,<br>
"What are we to do, my brothers?"<br>
Peter said to them,<br>
"Repent and be baptized, every one of you,<br>
in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins;<br>
and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>
For the promise is made to you and to your children<br>
and to all those far off,<br>
whomever the Lord our God will call."<br>
He testified with many other arguments, and was exhorting them,<br>
"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."<br>
Those who accepted his message were baptized,<br>
and about three thousand persons were added that day.</td>

If you are patient when you suffer for doing what is good,<br>
this is a grace before God.<br>
For to this you have been called,<br>
because Christ also suffered for you,<br>
leaving you an example that you should follow in his footsteps.<br><br>
                <i>He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.</i><br><br>

When he was insulted, he returned no insult;<br>
when he suffered, he did not threaten;<br>
instead, he handed himself over to the one who judges justly.<br>
He himself bore our sins in his body upon the cross,<br>
so that, free from sin, we might live for righteousness.<br>
By his wounds you have been healed.<br>
For you had gone astray like sheep,<br>
but you have now returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</td>

            <td class="aceem">Jesus said:<br>
"Amen, amen, I say to you,<br>
whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate<br>
but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber.<br>
But whoever enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.<br>
The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice,<br>
as the shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.<br>
When he has driven out all his own,<br>
he walks ahead of them, and the sheep follow him,<br>
because they recognize his voice.<br>
But they will not follow a stranger;<br>
they will run away from him,<br>
because they do not recognize the voice of strangers."<br>
Although Jesus used this figure of speech,<br>
the Pharisees did not realize what he was trying to tell them.<br><br>

So Jesus said again, "Amen, amen, I say to you,<br>
I am the gate for the sheep.<br>
All who came before me are thieves and robbers,<br>
but the sheep did not listen to them.<br>
I am the gate.<br>
Whoever enters through me will be saved,<br>
and will come in and go out and find pasture.<br>
A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy;<br>
I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly."
