           Our Lord Jesus came to reveal the name “Father.” Father speaks of family and of closeness and intimacy. You can know God as Elyon, the Most High. As El Shaddai, God Almighty. As Yehovah, the Lord, the covenant-keeping God. As Elohim, mighty Creator of the heavens and the earth. Every name is so significant as each one reveals a wonderful aspect of our God. But when you know God as Father, all His virtues, attributes, and power work for you to set you on high and deliver you.<br><br>

Our Lord Jesus prayed, “Now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep through Your name those whom You have given Me, that they may be one as We are” (John 17:11). The Greek word for “keep” here is the word tereo, which means to attend to carefully, to take care of, to guard, to watch, and to preserve. What is the name through which you will be kept guarded and protected? FATHER. Beloved, I want you to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you have a heavenly Father who loves you, who gave up His all for you, and who is vigilantly watching over you!<br><br>

He is your Father. Your Daddy. Your Abba.<br><br>

That is the name by which He wants you to call Him. When my son, Justin, has a nightmare, he doesn’t call out, “Pastor Prince!” He just cries out, “Abba!” and I am there, ready to take on any monsters hiding under his bed. In the same way, you can have complete assurance that when you call upon your Father, He will answer you. You can have full confidence in your Father’s protection and deliverance for you and your family, not because of your love for Him, but because of His love for you.

          What qualifies you for God’s protection?<br><br>

I ask this question because I have heard many ministers whose teachings make it seem like you have to qualify for God’s blessings. They make it sound like God blesses you only if you are able to love the Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.<br><br>

This also applies in the area of your protection. When they read, “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him”, they conclude that God’s protection is dependent on us fulfilling the condition of loving the Lord perfectly.<br><br>

Unfortunately, such teaching robs you of the faith to believe God for divine protection over yourself and your loved ones. Anything that is dependent on our efforts is on a shaky foundation, because no matter how “good” a Christian we think we are, our love for the Lord will fail.<br><br>

That is precisely why God sent His Son. He knew that man would never be able to fulfill all His commandments. In sending His Son, He was saying to us, “I know you can’t, so let Me love you with all My heart, all My mind, and all My strength.”<br><br>

Therein lies the beautiful love story we call the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

God SO loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son to save and ransom us. The Lord Jesus Christ Himself fulfilled all the requirements of the law. Today, even when our love for Him wavers, even when we fail, He still delivers us from evil!<br><br>

One Scripture that beautifully encapsulates the crux of the new covenant of grace is 1 John 4:10: “In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation [the atoning sacrifice] for our sins.”<br><br>

I pray that your heart will be anchored on this revelation. The emphasis of the new covenant is God’s love for you, not your love for God.<br><br>

Am I saying that your love for God is unimportant? Of course not. What I am saying is that our love for Him will always waver, but His love never fails.<br><br>

The Bible declares that “the steadfast love of the LORD never ceases” (Lam. 3:22 ). I am so grateful that we are under the new covenant of God’s amazing grace, where we can depend on His unconditional, unchanging, and irrevocable love for us!

He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor punished us according to our iniquities. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward those who fear Him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.</i><br></font>Psalm 103:8,10-12</h3>
            Psalm 103 is one of my favorite psalms of David, a beautiful psalm that describes who and what God really is—a gracious and merciful Savior. Believing right begins with what you believe about God and must be based on the solid foundation of God’s Word. To know the truth about who and what God is, we can’t go by feelings, circumstances, human conjectures, or what we may have heard someone say about God. We have to go to the source!<br><br>

If you heard a rumor that someone you knew was saying horrible and negative things about you, don’t believe it immediately. Go to the source first. Ask this person if this is what he or she really said or if this is what he or she really meant. Many people allow precious friendships and relationships to become fractured because they believe the rumors. They become bitter, angry, and disappointed without ever verifying with the person if he or she had actually said those nasty things.<br><br>

In the same way, in the world we live in, there are all kinds of wrong beliefs perpetuated about God: “God is angry at you.” “He is disappointed with you.” “God is allowing all these negative things to happen to you because He’s punishing you for your past sins.”<br><br>

Please do NOT believe all this baseless gossip about God! Such impressions of God have damaged many people’s relationships with Him, and they live with a distorted perspective of who God really is. Instead of receiving His love, grace, and forgiveness, they become afraid, distant, and fearful of Him. Instead of allowing Jesus to come into their situations, they live their lives running away, avoiding, and hiding from Him.<br><br>

Come on, let’s honor God and go to the source. Look again at what the Bible says about Him in today’s Scripture reading: He is “slow to anger, and abounding in mercy…as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.” This is our God! This is why you can always run to Him and believe that you can freely receive His help!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Keep yourselves in the love of God.</i><br></font>Jude 1:21</h3>
           As you wait for the doctor’s verdict on the nature of those cells he saw in your scan, or as you look at the dark mass on your X-ray, you can’t help but be filled with trepidation. You try telling yourself not to be fearful, but you can’t seem to stop fearing. Do you know why? Because you cannot reason your way out of fear. Fear is not logical.<br><br>

The only way to get fear out of your life is to cast it out, and the Bible tells us how:<br><br>

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment.<br><br>

—1 John 4:18<br><br>
You cast out fear by exposing yourself to the perfect love of God. Keep allowing His love to inundate you and drive out every fear. The Bible talks about keeping ourselves in the love of God. Instead of focusing on the pain in your body or the sickness causing your loved one to suffer, keep yourself in His love. Set your mind on the infallible, inexhaustible, and perfect love of your heavenly Father.<br><br>

You have a God who loves you so much He gave His Son to die on the cross for you. That, my friend, is why you can always have rock-solid assurance you are loved by Him. The Bible defines His love for us like this:<br><br>

God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him. This is real love—not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.<br><br>

1 John 4:9–10 <br><br>
The cross is everlasting proof of God’s love for you. The cross is the measure of how much He loves you. You must never judge His love based on your circumstances. The devil can attack your circumstances, but he can never attack the cross. Take your eyes off your circumstances and put them on the cross. That’s where God’s love for you was demonstrated once and for all.

And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word.

Therefore tell her to help me.” And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.”</i><br></font>Luke 10:38–42</h3>
            Martha was busy serving Jesus while her sister, Mary, sat at His feet and drew from Him words of life. Martha didn’t like it that Mary wasn’t helping her, so she complained about it to Jesus. Who do you think Jesus defended? Mary!<br><br>

My friend, many believers think that it’s better to give than to receive. Now, that’s true in our relationships with people. But when it comes to our relationship with the Lord, it’s better to RECEIVE from Him than to try to give to Him! Jesus describes Himself as the “bread of life”, in essence telling us that He wants us to partake of Him and receive from Him all the nourishment, strength, healing, provision and abundant life we can take!<br><br>

Our Lord loves it when we take from Him. That’s why Mary pleased Jesus. Beloved, I encourage you to be a Mary today. Our loving heavenly Father loves it when we draw from His unending reservoir of strength, wisdom, favor, peace and life!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God [Christ].</i><br></font>Romans 10:17</h3>
           Under the new covenant, we get to meditate on the person of Jesus when we meditate on the Word. Jesus is the Word made flesh and as you meditate on His love for you, on His finished work, on His forgiveness, and on His grace, God guarantees that you will have good success.<br><br>

You can just take one verse and meditate on Jesus’ love for you. For example, you can begin to mutter Psalm 23:1 under your breath: “The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want.” As you meditate on this simple verse, you begin to realize that the Lord is (present tense) your shepherd.<br><br>

A shepherd provides for his sheep, feeds them, and protects them. Because Jesus is your shepherd, you shall not be in want for anything. You shall not lack wisdom, direction, provision—anything. You begin to see that Jesus is present with you, providing for you, watching out for you, and making sure that you and your family will have more than enough.<br><br>

Now, right at that moment, in that short period of meditating on Jesus, faith is imparted and your heart is encouraged with the reality that Jesus is with you, even when you are facing some challenges.<br><br>

Whether you are a homemaker, salesperson, or business owner, your soul will be nourished and strengthened when you meditate on Jesus. In fact, every time you meditate on God’s Word, Jesus will propel you into success without you even realizing it! Without you having to scheme, devise, or make all sorts of plans, Jesus will direct your steps, lead you to the place that you are supposed to be at, and cause doors of opportunity to supernaturally open wide for you.<br><br>

When you meditate on Jesus, your ways always become prosperous. Now, don’t be afraid to use the word “prosperous.” It’s God’s promise in the Bible. When you meditate (mutter) on Jesus day and night, the Bible says that “you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success” (Josh. 1:8)!<br><br>

Some people think that they are prosperous once they have made their first million. But when you examine their lives, you find that somewhere along the way in their struggle to make more and more money, they have lost the very things that are really important.<br><br>

They may have built up an impressive investment portfolio, but their children want nothing to do with them anymore and they have hurt the people who once loved them. That is not true prosperity or good success.<br><br>

When God blesses you with prosperity, financial blessings are included, but only as a small part of the whole. Good success from Jesus will never take you away from your church. It will never take you away from your loved ones.<br><br>

Most of all, it will never take you away from yourself. You will not wake up one day in the midst of your pursuit of success and find that you no longer know the person looking back at you in the mirror.<br><br>

My friend, learn to meditate on the person of Jesus. He is your good success. When you have Him, you have everything.<br><br>

The Bible tells us that “faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” The word for “God” here in the original Greek text is Christos, referring to Christ. In other words, faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of Christ.<br><br>

Faith does not come just by hearing the Word of God. Faith comes by hearing the Word of Jesus and His finished work.<br><br>

In the same way, meditating on God’s Word is about meditating, muttering, and hearing about Jesus. This does not mean that you read only the four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. No, every page of the entire Bible from cover to cover points to the person of Jesus!<br><br>

If you desire to experience good success in your life, then I encourage you to meditate on messages preached by ministries that are all about exalting the person of Jesus, His beauty, His unmerited favor, and His perfect work for you on the cross.<br><br>

Listen to new covenant ministries that do not mix law and grace, but which rightly divide the Word of God and preach the unadulterated gospel of Jesus. The more you hear of Jesus and the cross, the more faith will be imparted to you and you will experience good success in your life!

But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</i><br></font>Matthew 6:31–33</h3>
            When I talk about not worrying and keeping our eyes on Jesus, some people think that I am not being practical. Beloved, you can worry all you like about your current crisis, but it will not improve or change your situation one bit. Please understand that I am not making light of what you are going through. I am just offering you the best solution I know that works. Your breakthrough will not come as a result of your struggling. It will come when you rest in the person of Jesus and His finished work.<br><br>

Jesus said, “Do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on...” (Matthew 6:25). Now, Jesus was not saying that these things—food, drink and clothing—are not important. In fact, He says that “your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.” But what Jesus wants us to do is to “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,” and He promises that “all these things shall be added to you.”<br><br>

Now, who is God’s righteousness? Jesus Christ. And who is the king of the “kingdom of God” that we are to seek? Jesus Christ (Revelation 19:16)! Jesus was actually referring to Himself when He was preaching this. When you seek Him first in your life and make Him your priority each day, all these material provisions—what you will eat, drink and wear—will be added to you. God does not delight in taking things away from you. He delights in adding to you, increasing you, promoting you and enriching you. Psalm 68:19 says, “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits.” The Lord loads us with benefits daily! That is how good our Savior is. His mercies and His unmerited favor are new every morning. That is the way to live and enjoy life, knowing that Jesus is with you and for you every step of the way.<br><br>

Put Jesus first in everything that you do. Honor Him and give Him preeminence in your daily life. Partake of His finished work daily by reading His living words to you. Practice the presence of Jesus and be conscious that He is with you, the same way that Joseph in the Bible was conscious that the Lord was with Him. Jesus will bless the works of your hands, and everything you touch will indeed prosper and bring good success into your life.

           Have you ever received a “word” from someone that brings your sins to remembrance or instills an expectation of punishment for sins in your life? If you have or do in the future, don’t fear it, just throw it out the window! Understand that all prophecies and messages you receive today must be filtered through the cross.<br><br>

Don’t allow anyone to tell you that something negative has happened to you or will happen to you because of God’s punishment against your sins. Reject such bad news in the name of Jesus.<br><br>

Instead, start receiving the good news of Jesus. When you are faced with difficult circumstances, keep on believing in His love that was demonstrated on the cross for you and He will cause whatever the devil meant for evil to be turned around for good and for His glory! When the devil throws lemons at you, God will turn them into lemonade for your enjoyment!<br><br>

There was a young couple in my church who had lost their baby due to some complications. And I was furious when I learned that a so-called “prophet” had told them that they had lost their baby because there was sin in their lives. That was really cruel! The couple was grieving, and instead of being a source of encouragement and edification, this “prophet” took advantage of the situation to appear prophetic at the expense of God’s precious people.<br><br>

We may not have all the answers, but we can have full assurance that the negative circumstances we sometimes experience are not the works of God, neither are they His punishments for our sins. When we have this confidence that God is for us and not against us, we can believe for restoration, breakthroughs, and good things to happen to us.<br><br>

Our church leaders told the young couple that it was not the Lord punishing them for their sins. They reminded them that all their sins have been punished at the cross of Jesus. This helped them to remove all the guilt and condemnation that they were carrying in their hearts. Since then, the Lord has blessed them with a beautiful baby.<br><br>

I have also received testimonies from other couples who received God’s restoration in this area. I noticed that these couples had one thing in common: after they heard the good news of the gospel of grace, it liberated them from all guilt and condemnation. Instead of believing that God was against them or punishing them, they started believing that He was for them. They started trusting aggressively in His grace and goodness. And without fail, restoration always came.<br><br>

Now, that’s God! When He restores, His restoration is always greater in quantity or quality. But think about it: if those couples continued to believe erroneously that God was punishing them because of their sins, they would never be able to muster the courage and trust God for restoration, for a new child.<br><br>

My friend, to reign in life it’s important you believe with all your heart that God is for you and not against you. His truth, His righteousness, His gospel, His salvation, His Word, and His Spirit declare that your sins have been punished on the cross. God is on your side. And if God is for you, who can be against you?

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.</i><br></font>Romans 8:1</h3>
            People who believe erroneously that God is hard on them for their failures will inevitably be hard on the people around them, and most of all, they will end up being really hard on themselves. They cannot forgive themselves for the mistakes they’ve made in the past and end up punishing themselves, whether they know it or not. It’s a vicious cycle of defeat. The more they can’t forgive themselves, the more they hurt themselves with all kinds of behaviors and the more they end up bound by various destructive addictions. This leads to even more guilt, which in turn drives them to punish themselves even more—and the cycle continues.<br><br>

I believe the root cause of many sinful habits, fears, and addictions can be traced to condemnation. I want to talk to you today about going after condemnation as the root to help you receive God’s forgiveness in those areas so that you can break out of your cycle of defeat and step into a new cycle of victory.<br><br>

Are you living with some unresolved guilt and condemnation today? I have great news for you. When you realize that God’s heart is not in condemnation but in forgiveness, your entire life can be turned around for His glory! I have personally witnessed so many lives transformed when they just take a small step of faith to believe in His grace and receive His forgiveness in their lives.<br><br>

Instead of punishing themselves for their mistakes and disqualifying themselves, these people began to correct their beliefs and receive God’s forgiveness by seeing Jesus taking on their punishment. They began to see their Savior qualifying them to receive every blessing from God for their marriages, families, and careers.<br><br>

Right now I want to encourage you to release the built-up guilt and condemnation for whatever mistakes you’ve made over the years to the Lord.<br><br>

Would you pray the prayer below with me? It’s a simple but powerful prayer. I encourage you to pray this prayer every time you fail and experience guilt and condemnation in your heart. Stop punishing yourself—your answer is found at the cross of Jesus. I promise you that when you turn to Jesus and remind yourself just how forgiven and righteous you are in Christ every time you fall short, you will start living like the forgiven and righteous person Jesus has made you.<br><br>

Lord Jesus, I don’t want to live under guilt and condemnation anymore. Today, I release all my failings, sins, and mistakes into Your loving hands. And I receive Your forgiveness right now into my heart. Thank You for Your precious blood that washes me whiter than snow. Right now I stand in Your righteousness, favor, joy, and peace. Amen!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Every man shall take for himself a lamb, according to the house of his father, a lamb for a household.</i><br></font>Exodus 12:3</h3>
           Jews worldwide celebrate the Passover feast. The feast, which has been kept for generations, commemorates the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt (Ex. 12:14).<br><br>

The night before the Israelites left Egypt, the destroyer went through the land killing the firstborn of man and beast. Only those households with the blood of the Passover lamb on their doorposts were spared.<br><br>

God had told the Israelites, “Take a lamb, a lamb for a household.” It was a lamb for each family. This tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is our true Passover Lamb, is for whole families to be saved!<br><br>

So your children are blessed once you receive Jesus. Your unsaved spouse and grandparents are blessed too, because Jesus is now the Lamb for your whole household. Your unsaved loved ones will enjoy the blessings of the saved.<br><br>

The Bible says that the sanctified will sanctify the unsanctified (1 Cor. 7:14). Yes, they will still need to personally receive Jesus as their Savior, but God has marked them for salvation because you are saved!<br><br>

Now, each household took a lamb which God said had to be without blemish. Why?<br><br>

Because the lamb typified Jesus, the true Lamb of God, who is without sin. John the Baptist said of Jesus, “Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29).<br><br>

The lamb was then killed, and its blood put on the two doorposts and lintel of the house (Ex. 12:7), such that it speaks of the cross. Today, the destroyer has to pass over every family that believes in the finished work of Jesus at the cross and puts its faith in His blood, because there has already been a death. The blood proves it—the innocent Lamb for the guilty family!<br><br>

Jesus also celebrated the Passover the night before He was crucified. But He was instituting the greater Passover. This time, it was not deliverance from Pharaoh and Egypt, but from Satan and his kingdom of darkness! It was not deliverance from slavery in Egypt, but from a life of bondage to sin to a life of liberty as free men in Christ!<br><br>

Beloved, Jesus, the Lamb of God, sacrificed Himself to set you free. And when the Son sets you free, you are free indeed!

            It is Jesus, His wisdom in your life, His righteousness and His perfect redemptive work on the cross that make you a success. So when you boast of your success, you can boast only in Jesus. Without Jesus, you have nothing to boast about. But with Jesus in your life, you can boast in Him and Him alone for every success and blessing that comes through His unmerited favor. If you are strong, mighty and wise in yourself, then God’s unmerited favor cannot flow. But when you realize your weaknesses and foolishness, and depend on Jesus instead, that is when His unmerited favor can flow unhindered in your life.<br><br>

We see this in the story of Moses. In his first 40 years as an Egyptian prince who was looked up to and admired, he thought that he knew everything. The Bible says that in this first 40 years, Moses was “mighty in words and deeds” (Acts 7:22), but God could not use him. However, in the next 40 years, something happened to Moses. He had fled Egypt after killing an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew, and went to dwell in the Midian desert. He became a shepherd and was no longer considered mighty in words nor deeds. Indeed, he had even become a stutterer (Exodus 4:10). And at this point in his life, when he probably thought that he was a has-been, insignificant compared to what he had been, and that his glory-days were behind him, God appeared to him and said, “I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people...out of Egypt” (Exodus 3:10).<br><br>

Forty years earlier, at the zenith of his ability, Moses could not even bury properly one Egyptian whom he had killed—he was found out and forced to flee (Exodus 2:11–15). But now, stripped of his dependence on his human strength and mindful of his weaknesses, he stepped into his call, dependent solely on the unmerited favor of God. And this time, when Moses waved his rod over the sea, the sea covered tens of thousands of Egyptians perfectly (Exodus 14:26–28).<br><br>

The Bible tells us that “God resists the proud, but gives grace [unmerited favor] to the humble” (1 Peter 5:5). Beloved, God will not impose His unmerited favor on us. Whenever we want to depend on ourselves and our wisdom, He will allow us to do so. His unmerited favor is given to those who humbly acknowledge that they cannot succeed in their own strength and ability. When we let go and depend on His unmerited favor, He will take over and do for us what we cannot do for ourselves!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>God is love.</i><br></font>1 John 4:8</h3>
           How we see God is important because a faulty perception of God can result in a lifetime of fear and bondage. Too many people have a wrong impression of God because for generations people have portrayed Him as hard, angry, unfeeling, and condemning, just waiting for man to trip up.<br><br>

These portrayals of God cause many sincere people to have an unhealthy fear of God. And when they believe that God is against them and out to punish them, they find it impossible to break out of their sins, addictions, anxieties, and fears.<br><br>

My friend, if you’ve been shown a God of judgment and anger all your life, let the Scriptures reveal to you His true nature:<br><br>

“But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness” (Ps. 86:15).
“The Lord our God is merciful and forgiving” (Dan. 9:9).
“O LORD, Your tender mercies and Your loving-kindnesses . . . they are from of old” (Ps. 25:6).
This is our God! Our God is love! He is slow to anger, gracious, and patient. He is full of forgiveness, loving-kindness, and tender mercies. Thank God we can go to the Holy Word for the truth!<br><br>

If you want to further understand the true nature of God, just look at Jesus. He said, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father. . . . The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works” (John 14:9–10).<br><br>

Have you ever seen Jesus provoked and angry with sinners, prostitutes, or tax collectors? Did He berate the woman at the well who had five husbands, or the woman who was caught in adultery?<br><br>

Now, He was at times angry with the self-righteous, hard-hearted, grace-resisting scribes and Pharisees, but He was always kind and loving toward the sinners and outcasts of society. That’s the nature of your heavenly Father!<br><br>

Jesus demonstrated such graciousness that His haters sarcastically labeled Him “a friend of sinners” to cast aspersions on His integrity (Matt. 11:19). But what was intended to be a derogatory label is really a beautiful picture of His grace.<br><br>

Grace doesn’t shun the sinner; grace pursues the sinner. Grace doesn’t picket against those who fall short; grace embraces them into wholeness and brings about real inward transformation for them. Grace does not condemn those struggling against sin; grace produces holiness in them.<br><br>

Sinners found hope, joy, and liberty in Jesus. He showed them His grace and His grace transformed them from living a life of sin to living a life of holiness. He never condoned their sins. A thousand times no. How could He, when He gave His life to save them from their sins!<br><br>

We see an example of our Lord’s love for sinners when He befriended the corrupt tax collector, Zacchaeus. He invited Himself over to Zacchaeus’s home, loved him, and showed him grace. Before the night was over, Zacchaeus stood in the presence of all his dinner guests and said to Jesus, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold” (Luke 19:8).<br><br>

That’s the power of grace! Grace changes people’s lives from the inside out. Jesus gave Zacchaeus no commandments, no condemnation, no laws . . . just grace, grace, and more grace. And Zacchaeus’s heart was forever transformed. Grace produces true holiness.

            I believe that Jesus is doing a great work in your life right now. Maybe you can’t see it because there’s something that you have done in your past that you just can’t seem to shake off, that seems like weights around your feet holding you down. Beloved, today is the day for your breakthrough. Learn to see what God sees by fixing your eyes on Jesus.<br><br>

You need to understand that what you see or how others see you is not as important as how God sees you. Many people think that God sees them in their sins and is just waiting to pounce on them to punish them. This wrong belief produces wrong living. If you see God this way, you can’t help but be in constant fear, insecurity, and anxiety over your past sins. Today, make a decision to turn your eyes to Jesus, for He has already made you, the believer, righteous with His blood!<br><br>

In fact, the more you behold Jesus, the more you are transformed “from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord” (2 Cor. 3:18). Fixing your eyes on Jesus is the greatest holiness. Many think they have to do more in order to be more holy, accepted, and loved by God. The truth is, when you behold Jesus more and see His love, His forgiveness, His abundant grace, and His gift of righteousness purchased for you with His own blood, you will be transformed supernaturally.<br><br>

Holiness is a by-product of seeing Jesus in His grace. When you see Jesus and receive His love and grace every day, your heart is transformed inwardly. This is not outward behavior modification. This is real change that is sustained by a heart touched by His grace and by an emancipated conscience that is forever freed from guilt. This is when that addiction begins to drop from your life. This is when that fear begins to dissolve in His perfect love, and that condemnation arising from your past mistakes is cleansed by His precious blood.<br><br>

What a life! This is the life that God wants you to experience. Can you see it? Can you see what He sees?

           For six whole hours, the Son of God was suspended between heaven and earth. And at the height of His suffering on the cross, He cried out in the deep darkness, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matt. 27:45–46).<br><br>

For the first time, Jesus addressed His Father as “God.” The Father had forsaken the Son. As Judge of the universe, God had to turn His back on His Son, who was carrying the filth of the world’s sins, for His eyes are too pure to behold evil (Hab. 1:13).<br><br>

If the Father had not turned His back on His Son, He would have to turn His back on you today when you call out to Him in your hour of need. But because Jesus has taken your place, today, you take His place, and you have God’s face smiling on you always!<br><br>

Right now, God’s face is smiling on you. His countenance is shining on you. I can stand before you and declare, “The Lord make His face shine upon you” (Num. 6:25–26). And it is all because Jesus has paid the price for God to never leave you nor forsake you (Heb. 13:5).<br><br>

As Judge, God turned His back on His Son. But as Father, He cried. His heart was broken because Christ was never more pleasing to Him than when He was on the cross. Christ’s suffering was a sweet-smelling aroma to the Father (Eph. 5:2).<br><br>

Do you remember what Jesus said? “Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again” (John 10:17). If you are a parent, you love each one of your children equally. But when one of them does something special for you out of love, it touches your heart and you just want to run to him and hug him.<br><br>

That was what happened at the cross, except that the Father could not embrace His Son. Instead, He had to turn His back on His Son because our sins had to be punished in His Son’s body.<br><br>

Beloved, when you cry out to the Father for help today, know that He hears you and will surely help you. Because of Jesus, He will never turn His back on you!

            In the darkest moments of our lives, we often feel like God is a thousand miles away. God is with us on the mountaintops, we think, but in the valleys, we’re all alone.<br><br>

Nothing could be further from the truth. In 1 Kings 20, the Syrian king was told that Syria had fought Israel on the hills and lost because Israel’s God was the God of the hills. So if they fought the Israelites in the valleys, they would win. Of course, the misinformed Syrians lost again because God is a God of the valleys too!<br><br>

My friend, there’s nowhere you can go where you’re not covered by God’s mercy and grace. Whether you are in the pink of health or terribly ill in the valley of the shadow of death, He is with you and will never leave you nor forsake you. So don’t lose hope.

           Something very unique and precious happens when you see that the Lord is with you. Trust the Lord to open your eyes to see Him in your situation, and the more you see Him, the more He manifests Himself.<br><br>

If you are in the midst of committing to an important business agreement, I assure you that if you can see the Lord there with you, His wisdom will flow through you, and He will give you supernatural insight to locate any loopholes, details, or exit clauses that are missing from that contract that you are about to sign.<br><br>

Once you involve Jesus and acknowledge His presence, you will sense Him intervening in any decision you are about to make, through the absence or presence of His peace. Sometimes, everything can appear to be in order on the surface, but somehow, you may sense a discomfort rising up in you every time you think about your decision. My advice to you would be to not rush into it.<br><br>

You see, once you have involved the Lord, the lack of peace that you feel is often His leading to protect you. You can even be in the midst of an argument with your spouse, but the moment you become conscious of the Lord’s presence, your words will change. Somehow, there will be a supernatural restraint that you know is not from yourself. That is also the Lord!<br><br>

Beloved, it is important for you to eradicate the notion that the Lord is present to find fault with you. You may have been raised in an environment where your parents were constantly picking on your faults and pointing out your mistakes, but don’t project this characteristic onto the Lord.<br><br>

God knows every idiosyncrasy about you, yet He loves you perfectly because He sees you through the lens of the cross, where His Son has removed every failing from your life. This means that even your current argument with your spouse is washed by the blood of Jesus.<br><br>

The Lord’s presence is with you not to judge you or smack you on the head with a giant bat the moment you fail. No, my friend, His presence is with you to direct you, guide you, lead you into becoming more like Christ, and to make you a success in every endeavor you undertake.

            Where is this secret place of the Most High and how do you get there? Before I answer this question, I want you to be careful of preaching and teaching about Psalm 91 that make “the secret place of the Most High” a place that only an elite few can go to, while the rest of us have no access to it because we haven’t done enough, such as pray for eight hours. Usually, the person who teaches along these lines is trying to say that there is a standard of holiness that you must attain before you can reach the secret place of the Most High. Now, if this is true and it takes eight hours of prayer at home to be in the secret place of the Most High, then how about those of us who have full-time jobs and can’t pray for eight hours, and who really need protection?<br><br>

Think about it for a moment. Who needs more protection—the one praying in the safety of his home or the one working out there? Clearly, it is the guy who is working out there in the world where accidents are possible and where he is exposed to all kinds of viruses. Yet, according to this teaching, he cannot access the secret place because he has not prayed eight hours a day! Does this even make sense to you? That’s why I don’t like teaching that makes certain people—especially the preacher—appear like they are part of an elite few. The Lord’s blessings are not just for an elite few. If a blessing is from our Lord, everyone has access to it. The young and the old, the strong and the weak, the rich and the poor—all have access by faith to His blessings that are freely given (see Today's Scripture).<br><br>

Let me tell you where the secret place of the Most High is. The secret place of the Most High is a place where you are in Christ. Wouldn’t you agree that being in Christ is to be in the safest hiding place? How did you get to be in Christ? By receiving the Lord Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior. Once you are a born-again believer, our heavenly Father sees you in Christ. You are safe, protected, and secure in the hiding place! Be anchored in this truth and see yourself walking in a greater measure of His divine protection in the days to come.

           The Bible tells us that Christ was delivered up for our sins and raised from the dead for our justification. You may already know why Jesus died for our sins but do you know the significance of God raising Him from the dead?<br><br>

Let me give you an illustration to help you understand the significance of Jesus’ resurrection.<br><br>

Let’s say that you are living in a foreign country. One day, you happen to break a major rule of the land. You appeal to the king for mercy. He says, “A rule is a rule. I cannot bend the rule for you. What will others say about my integrity? However, if you can find a substitute to take your punishment—three months in jail—I will allow it.”<br><br>

By God’s grace, you find a willing substitute. He goes to prison on your behalf and you don’t see him for some time. Days, weeks, and months pass by.<br><br>

Now, how or when will you know that your crime has been fully paid for? When will you be able to rest easy regarding your crime? It is when you see your substitute walking free again!<br><br>

When you see him out of prison, you will know that the sentence has been fully served. You will know that you are now justified and no one can bring a charge against you for your old crime. No longer will you be afraid of the king or his guards coming after you because you know that the one who was punished in your place is now walking free.<br><br>

Beloved, Jesus, your substitute, paid the debt you could not pay. On the cross, He bore the sins of your entire life. God put it all on Jesus and then He punished Jesus for every single one of those sins until He was fully satisfied. And because He was so pleased with what Jesus had done, He raised Him from the dead.<br><br>

Today, Jesus’ tomb remains empty. He is not there for He has risen! His resurrection and empty tomb will forever be our assurance that we have been fully justified. You no longer have to be afraid of God judging you for your sins. His justice is on your side today!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>“He has not observed iniquity in Jacob, nor has He seen wickedness in Israel.”</i><br></font>Numbers 23:21</h3>
            Learn to see what God sees. Take a closer look at what God says in the verse above and just pause for a moment. Was there iniquity in Israel? (When God used the word “Jacob” here, He was referring to all the children of Israel.) Was there any sin in Israel? Or was everybody in the encampment perfect?<br><br>

If you were to zoom in from the top of the mountain into the encampment of Israel, it’s not hard to imagine that a wide variety of imperfections, sins, iniquities, and wickedness was present throughout the camp. But the question is, did God see it?<br><br>

Look at Numbers 23:21 again. Notice that God did not say there was no sin or iniquity in His people. He simply said He did not see it. Similarly, He is not saying that there is no sin in you. What God says is, “I don’t see it.”<br><br>

Wait a minute, how can an unbendingly holy God not see sin in me?<br><br>

My friend, it is because those same holy eyes saw all your sins punished in the body of Jesus Christ. Your sins were punished into nonexistence.<br><br>

In the Israelite encampment, even though there were iniquities, sins, and wickedness, God did not see any of them because the blood of bulls and goats, which they offered up to the Lord daily, covered the children of Israel. How much more true that is for us today, we who are washed clean forever by the blood of the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, our beautiful Savior.<br><br>

Under the old covenant, the Israelites enjoyed a temporal covering through the animal sacrifices, but for us, the atonement and payment for all our sins by Jesus Christ is eternal. That is why God does not observe sin and iniquity in you nor has He seen wickedness in you. When God looks at you today, He sees you as a righteous, forgiven, healed, favored, blessed, accepted, and beloved son or daughter because of the cross of Jesus.<br><br>

Now, do you see yourself as God sees you?

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</i><br></font>Romans 3:20</h3>
           Beloved, understanding the purpose of the law is critical to your relationship with God. He gave the law for one purpose: that you would have the knowledge of sin and recognize your need for a Savior.<br><br>

Without the law, there would be no sin (Rom. 4:15). For example, if there is no law on how fast you can drive on a particular road, that is, if there is no speed limit, the state trooper cannot stop you and give you a ticket for speeding. In simple terms, no law equals no sin. No recognition of sin equals no need for a Savior!<br><br>

The law was thus given to bring man to the end of himself so that in his despair, he would see his need for Jesus. Because of the law, no man can say that he is not a sinner and no man can say that he doesn’t need Jesus. That is the purpose of the law. It was not designed to make you godly, but to expose your ungodliness.<br><br>

What the devil wants to do is keep the law over your head all the time so that you constantly feel condemned and guilty. That is how he keeps you trapped in a cycle of defeat. The devil is the master legalist who constantly reminds you of how unworthy you are of God’s blessings. Known as the accuser of the brethren (Rev. 12:10), here are some of his common attacks:<br><br>

You call yourself a Christian? You are a hypocrite!<br><br>

Forget about praying. God will never listen to your prayers.<br><br>

Look at your life. How dare you step into church?<br><br>

My friend, these are lies, all lies! The devil is using the law to make you conscious of all your shortcomings. But through Jesus Christ, you are no longer under the condemnation of the law. The devil has been disarmed by the power of the cross!<br><br>

Jesus, who knew no sin, was condemned on your behalf on the cross. Through Jesus Christ, you are now made righteous apart from the works of the law.<br><br>

So when you hear the voice of the accuser condemning you, remind yourself that you are the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). Declare it out loud! Come on, say it with me three times, each time louder than the first:<br><br>

I am the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ! I am the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ! I am the righteousness of God in Jesus Christ!<br><br>

Righteousness is a gift. It is not a reward for perfect obedience to the law. You are clothed today not in your own righteousness, which is self-righteousness, but with the righteousness of Jesus Christ. God sees you as righteous as Jesus Himself. This is your permanent, eternal standing before Him because of what Christ has done for you.<br><br>

And hey, when you are clothed in Jesus’ righteousness, any obstacle that tries to obstruct you from living your life to the fullest, whether it’s an addiction, sickness, fear, or depression, has to go!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.</i><br></font>1 Corinthians 6:17</h3>
           One of our key ministry partners, Ron, shared how he had a dear friend named Tyler, who was from a good Christian family, was great at sports, and was living the “American Dream.” After college, however, Tyler started hanging out with the wrong crowd and developed a severe drug and drinking problem, which in turn led to a series of devastating mistakes. Within a twenty-four-month period, Tyler lost everything he held dear in his life. Ashamed and miserable, Tyler dropped out of church and almost gave up on life, God, and grace. But God, in His grace, was still reaching out to Tyler (through Ron), as Ron related in this story:<br><br>

One night, while jogging at a park and listening to a message by Pastor Prince, I felt God prompting me to send Tyler a text message. I felt that God wanted me to ask Tyler, “What does God see when He looks at you?” So while running, I texted him exactly those words. After a long time, I received his text reply:<br><br>
Tyler: “Are you serious?”<br><br>
Ron: “Yes.”<br><br>
Tyler: “Well…I’m sure it’s not good.”<br><br>
Ron: “Jesus.”<br><br>
Tyler: “What do you mean?”<br><br>
Ron: “I mean, when God looks at you, He sees Jesus!”<br><br>
Thirty minutes later, I got this message:<br><br>
Tyler: “Thanks, man, you don’t know how badly I needed to
hear that!”<br><br>
Would it bless your heart to know that this is the very message God wants you to receive today? If you are like Tyler, then you believe God’s love for you depends on your actions. You honestly believe God is ashamed of you because of your mistakes and failures. Well, you may have either not heard or have forgotten that the payment for your sins has already been made in full upon the body of Jesus at the cross. Therefore, when God looks at you today, He doesn’t judge, esteem, and measure you according to your imperfections. He sees you in the Beloved—He sees you in Christ, and He sees the blood that has been shed for you by His dear Son.<br><br>

When God looks at you today, He sees Jesus. Because of this, His thoughts toward you are thoughts of loving-kindness, forgiveness, blessings, and favor. Jesus paid an immensely heavy price on the cross so that you can live life completely accepted and unconditionally loved by God. Knowing and believing this will make all the difference in how you live your life—no matter what is staring you in the face.

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>For we walk by faith, not by sight.</i><br></font>2 Corinthians 5:7</h3>
          Some years ago, the wife of one of my key leaders was diagnosed with a cyst in her womb that the doctors said had to be removed by surgery. She was told they might even have to remove her whole womb. Of course, this couple was very affected by the news. I met with them to pray with them and to partake of the holy Communion.<br><br>

Honestly, I didn’t feel any faith when I prayed for them. In fact, I felt quite helpless. But I heard the Lord telling me to rest. I heard Him telling me not to even try to use faith and to simply rest in His faith. So I simply said, “Growth, I curse you to your roots in Jesus’ name. Be plucked out by your roots and be thrown into the sea.” At the same time, I also prayed the Lord would cause her youth to be renewed like the eagle’s.<br><br>

A few days later, she had a final scan before her surgery. And guess what? Her gynecologist said the whole growth had simply disappeared and that it was a miracle! But the Lord didn’t stop there. Her monthly period had actually stopped for some time, but soon after I prayed for her, it returned. The Lord had renewed her womb and her youth. Hallelujah!<br><br>

I felt no faith when I prayed for her, but her healing was not dependent on what I felt about my faith. Don’t look at your own faith and think, I don’t have enough faith for the breakthrough I need. Faith is nothing more than looking to Jesus.<br><br>

There were only two individuals in the Gospels whom Jesus described as having “great faith”: the centurion who believed Jesus only had to speak a word and his servant at home would be healed (Matt. 8:5–13) and the Syro-Phoenician woman to whom Jesus said, “O woman, great is your faith!” (Matt. 15:21–28).<br><br>

And neither of them was conscious of their own faith.<br><br>

Do you want to know what they were conscious of? They were conscious of Jesus. They saw Him as the One who was faithful and powerful. They had a great estimation of His grace and goodness. And as they saw Him in His grace, He saw them in their faith!<br><br>

Don’t worry about whether or not you have enough faith. Just look to Jesus. Spend time in His presence. Watch or listen to sermons that are full of Jesus. When you touch Jesus, you touch faith because He is the author and finisher of faith (Heb. 12:2). The Bible declares He is faithful, and He will not allow you to go through more than what you can bear (1 Cor. 10:13). He will carry you through.

            Something very unique and precious happens when you see that the Lord is with you. Trust the Lord to open your eyes to see Him in your situation, and the more you see Him, the more He manifests Himself. If you are in the midst of committing to an important business agreement, I assure you that if you can see the Lord there with you, His wisdom will flow through you, and He will give you supernatural insight to locate any loopholes, details or exit clauses that are missing from that contract that you are about to sign.<br><br>


Once you involve Jesus and acknowledge His presence, you will sense Him intervening in any decision you are about to make, through the absence or presence of His peace. Sometimes, everything can appear to be in order on the surface, but somehow, you may sense a discomfort rising up in you every time you think about your decision. My advice to you would be to not rush into it. You see, once you have involved the Lord, the lack of peace that you feel is often His leading to protect you. You can even be in the midst of an argument with your spouse, but the moment you become conscious of the Lord’s presence, your words will change. Somehow, there will be a supernatural restraint that you know is not from yourself. That is also the Lord!<br><br>


Beloved, it is important for you to eradicate the notion that the Lord is present to find fault with you. You may have been raised in an environment where your parents were constantly picking on your faults and pointing out your mistakes, but don’t project this characteristic onto the Lord. God knows every idiosyncrasy about you, yet He loves you perfectly because He sees you through the lens of the cross, where His Son has removed every failing from your life. This means that even your current argument with your spouse is washed by the blood of Jesus.<br><br>

The Lord’s presence is with you not to judge you or smack you on the head with a giant bat the moment you fail. No, my friend, His presence is with you to direct you, guide you, lead you into becoming more like Christ, and to make you a success in every endeavor you undertake

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from Him and healed them all.</i><br></font>Luke 6:19</h3>
           Trembling at the thought of being seen and stoned by the crowds, the man with leprosy crouched beneath one of the many stone slabs dotting the slopes of the picturesque hills that framed the Sea of Galilee. He had come to see the man they called Jesus, Who he had heard was a healer.<br><br>


People had talked about how Jesus healed—how everyone who had gone to Him for healing received their healing. He turned none away. Whatever their conditions—fevers, paralyses, deaf ears, or demonic oppression—He healed them all.<br><br>


All. That little word gave him hope that perhaps even he might be made whole. By the time he reached the hills, a large multitude had gathered on the slopes to listen to Jesus teach. This poor diseased man couldn’t see Jesus from where he was hiding in fear, but because of the unique acoustics of the hills, he could hear every word that Jesus was speaking to the multitudes:<br><br>


“And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you” (Matt. 6:28–30).<br><br>


He listened attentively—the timbre of Jesus’ voice and every word He spoke carried an immeasurable depth of understanding and empathy for his everyday fears. Embers of hope that he had thought long dead suddenly flared to life, fanned by the authority of Jesus’ words. Whereas he had initially trembled from fear of being exposed, now he began trembling with a different emotion that made him listen even more fervently.<br><br>


As the meaning of Jesus’ words sank in, the man with leprosy began to weep. For the first time in years, he wondered, Is this possible? That God wants to be a Father to me? A heavenly Father Who would clothe me much better than the lilies, which are better clothed than Solomon in all his glory, if I put my trust in Him? Is it possible that God is reaching out to me with kindness, acceptance, and love, and inviting me to taste and receive His goodness? After all the years of being rejected and living as an outcast, something deep within his heart broke at these new thoughts and brought on a fresh flood of tears.<br><br>


Galvanized by the unmistakable compassion in Jesus’ voice that caused hope to race along every still-intact nerve in his body, the man crawled out of his makeshift shelter the moment Jesus finished speaking. All thoughts of staying hidden were gone. All he wanted to do was to go to Jesus and ask Him to take his disease away.<br><br>


As he began to make his way to Jesus, there, coming down the hill, a man walking slightly ahead of a few others caught his eye. He realized it was Jesus, coming straight toward him.<br><br>


Instead of having gone straight down to the crowds after preaching to them, the Lord had turned another way to go toward the lone, afflicted man, as if He already knew all about the man’s need and where he was. Unable to hold back his feelings, the man fell at Jesus’ feet and worshiped Him.<br><br>


In a voice still choked with tears, he whispered, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” Without hesitation, Jesus reached out and touched him. “I am willing,” He said, with the same compassion and warmth the man had heard earlier in His voice. “Be cleansed” (Matt. 8:2–3).<br><br>


As he felt the touch of Jesus’ warm hands, the man closed his eyes involuntarily and his body shuddered under that touch. It had been so long since he had felt the touch of another human being, let alone a warm and loving touch.<br><br>


Then he opened his eyes to look at Jesus, and found Him smiling at him with love in His eyes. Sensing that something was different about his body, the man looked down at his hands, which a moment ago had been covered with open sores and had ended in stubs for fingers. His eyes beheld healthy hands with fingers fully formed and skin completely whole.<br><br>


Like one in a dream, he began lifting the sleeves and hem of his robe and watched in amazement as the cloth rolled upward to reveal smooth, unblemished skin covering his arms, legs, and feet. He was cleansed! The power of Jesus had, in an instant, swallowed up his uncleanness.<br><br>


He looked up into the face of the One Who had made him whole, overcome with gratitude. Even as he turned to go, the man knew he would never forget the compassion and encouragement he had seen in our Lord Jesus’ face, nor His warm and affirming touch.<br><br>

He has not just healed and cleansed me, the elated man thought as he walked away in wonder. He has given me back my life!

         Beloved, in the natural, there are so many reasons for us to be afraid. We can be fearful of terrorist attacks. We can be worried about contracting diseases and plagues. We can be anxious about destruction and accidents. Round the clock, there seems to be legitimate reasons for us to be filled with dread.<br><br>


But there is a realm that is higher than what we see in the natural, and I declare to you today that YOU SHALL NOT BE AFRAID. Fear is a spiritual condition, and cannot be combated with a natural answer, or by us trying to reason it away. The Bible tells us that the natural mind cannot understand things that are spiritual (see 1 Cor. 2:14).<br><br>


So how can you not be afraid? Invite the God of peace to reign in your life. As you do that, the robust peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and mind through Christ Jesus.<br><br>

Beloved, as you allow the Lord Jesus to be your refuge and your hiding place, you can receive the peace that He gives. Today, hear your Lord Jesus whispering to you, “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid” (John 14:27). Receive His supernatural peace, which is beyond what is logical, beyond what your limited mind can comprehend. Receive His supernatural peace that will guard your heart and become a bulwark for your mind. And may Jehovah Shalom, our God of Peace, fill your heart and set you free to live fearlessly in these dangerous times!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.</i><br></font>2 Peter 3:9</h3>
          The word “repentance” in the New Testament is the Greek word metanoia, which simply means “a change of mind.” Meta means “change” and noia refers to your mind. There are religious folks who have this idea that repentance means groveling in dirt and condemning themselves until they feel they have sufficiently earned God’s forgiveness.<br><br>


My question is, how condemned and sorrowful do they need to be before they have genuinely “repented”? And after they have “repented,” should they fail again in the same area, does it mean that they did not really “repent” completely the first time?<br><br>


I do not doubt the sincerity of people who believe in “repentance” this way. However, you can be sincere in your intent but still be sincerely wrong when repentance is not based on right believing that leads to inward heart transformation.<br><br>


It is possible to beat your breast sorrowfully, put on sackcloth and ashes, cry your eyeballs out, and remain unchanged. Sorrow doesn’t equal transformation.<br><br>


It is right believing that brings about true repentance (change of mind) and hence genuine transformation. It is impossible to truly repent the Bible way—to experience Jesus, His love, His grace, and His power and to allow Him to change your mind and your belief system—and still remain the same.<br><br>


Can you see how man-centered teachings on contrition and repentance can sound so good, but in reality trap people in a permanent cycle of defeat and hypocrisy? The truth is, if you are a new creation in Christ, you already hate the sin and the wrongdoing. It vexes your soul, and you are looking for a way out of your bondage.<br><br>


The repentance you need—the change of mind you need—is to know that God has already forgiven you. Stop condemning yourself and walk in His righteous identity to new levels of victory over sin.<br><br>


Now that you understand what Bible repentance is, let’s apply it to winning the battle for your mind. When wrong thoughts come into your head, the repentance or change of mind that you need is to know that those thoughts don’t belong to you.<br><br>


Repentance in this situation is not about beating yourself up over those thoughts. I used to do that and it only left me more oppressed and defeated.<br><br>


No, give them no room to flourish by ignoring them while you continue to be established and secure in your identity in Christ. Fill your mind with His thoughts, His living Word, His peace, His joy, and His love.

            It must have drawn many looks—some curious, some sympathetic, some possibly of disgust. For the owner and all who saw it, the withered hand must have spelled “challenging”, “difficult” and very likely, “impossible to heal”.<br><br>

But where others saw the witheredness, Jesus saw only God’s supply of healing and wholeness available to the man. That’s why He said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” Jesus didn’t see the lack others saw. He only saw the Father’s superabundant supply of grace all over that withered hand. He saw the Father’s heart to heal and bless the man!<br><br>

Today, don’t focus on your pain, symptoms or the doctor’s negative report. Whether it’s an aching back, ailing heart or barren womb, see His healing power enveloping your body. See His grace supplying life and health to you!

           When negative thoughts come your way, you must not give them time to take root in your heart. This correlates with the wise saying that you can’t stop birds from flying over your head, but you can surely stop them from building a nest on your head.<br><br>

We can’t stop the enemy from attacking our minds, but we can surely defend ourselves with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (Eph. 6:17). God’s Word is infallible, unshakable, and everlasting (Isa. 40:8, 1 Pet. 1:25).<br><br>

Our Lord Jesus Himself showed us what to do when we are under attack by the devil. Three times He was tempted by Satan in the wilderness. Each time, His response was the same—He quoted the written Word of God. Against each attack, His response was to say, “It is written” (Matt. 4:1–11).<br><br>

I know of believers who say, “God spoke to me and told me that He will do that for me.” I want to encourage you not to go by what you think the Lord said to you. You cannot fight the devil by saying, “God spoke to me,” apart from the written Word. Please understand that I am not at all against God speaking to you, but coming against the enemy and his attacks with “God spoke to me” is not what our Lord Jesus did.<br><br>

My friend, if you want to combat the enemy’s attacks, stick to the pattern that our Lord Jesus showed us. In the first temptation, the devil challenged our Lord Jesus to prove His identity, saying, “If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread” (Matt. 4:3).<br><br>

Don’t you think it is interesting that our Lord did not rely on what His Father had audibly spoken over Him at the River Jordan? A voice had come from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matt. 3:17).<br><br>

Yet, the Lord did not point Satan to the spoken word of God. Over and over again, He declared, “It is written.” Now, if the Son of God used “it is written” to defeat the devil, how much more you and I need to.<br><br>

When fear grips your heart or evil thoughts plague your mind, quote His written Word!

            What does “the truth shall make you free” really mean?

Examine the context of this verse and you’ll notice that Jesus said this to the Jews of His day. These were people who at an early age grew up studying and learning the law. Yet, these people, in ways very similar to us today, still battled with fears, anxieties, sicknesses, and all kinds of oppression, bondages, and addictions. So this truth that Jesus was talking about clearly cannot be the law, because these people could not find freedom in the law. In fact, the truth of the law only brought them into religious bondage.<br><br>

My friend, the truth that shall make you free, is the truth of His grace. This is the truth that He came to give us. His Word proclaims that “grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17).<br><br>

The good news is that grace came to set you free from the curse of the law. Grace is not a doctrine or a theological subject. When Jesus talks about grace, He is talking about Himself. Grace is a person. Grace is Jesus Himself.<br><br>

The truth that has the power to fling wide open your prison doors is His grace. His grace is the antidote to counteract every poison in your mind! When you encounter Jesus, taste His love, and savor His loving-kindness and tender mercies, every wrong belief begins to dissolve in the glory of His love. And every dark thought and evil addiction that may have held you captive cannot but scatter when it is exposed to the light of His grace!<br><br>

Your freedom is found in rightly believing in Jesus—His favor and His love in your life. When you believe right about His grace, you will begin to live right. The more you see in His Word what His grace has done for you, the more fears, condemnation, depression, and destructive habits will lose their grip in your life. And the more you believe and enjoy His grace and love, the more you’ll find the Lord’s wisdom, stability, and peace guiding your decisions and actions.<br><br>

Right believing always produces right living and the right results.

           When you study your Bible knowing that the Lord is with you, you will be amazed at how God’s Word comes alive. That is how I read the Word. I don’t study it just to prepare for messages to preach on Sundays. I come to the Word to drink of the living waters from Jesus.<br><br>

I am conscious that Jesus is by my side, teaching me, speaking to my heart, and I can tell you that we have the best conversations during these times and I always come away from such times feeling refreshed and energized.<br><br>

Reading His Word has become a great personal time of intimacy between Jesus and me. I get completely lost and absorbed in His presence until I lose track of time. I can’t tell you the number of times when I had looked up at my clock after digging into His Word and realized that it was already five in the morning!<br><br>

You know what it's like when you are enjoying a steaming cup of latte in a café with friends that you love, and you are having so much fun, laughing and sharing, that time just seems to disappear? Well, you can enjoy Jesus’ presence in the same way!<br><br>

Once you are conscious that Jesus is with you, reading the Bible no longer feels like a chore or duty. You won’t catch yourself watching the clock going tick . . . tick . . . tick . . . tick . . . tick . . . and feeling as though an eternity has passed even though only five minutes has lapsed!<br><br>

That is what a chore feels like—as if time is standing still and you can’t wait to get it over with. Bible study divorced from His presence is a dead work. But when it is like catching up with your best friend, there never seems to be enough time!<br><br>

So see the Lord in the midst of everything that you do and learn to bring Him into the picture. He makes everything beautiful in your life. When you look at your past, the scars of yesterday may still be throbbing in your memories.<br><br>

Perhaps you were sexually abused as a child or you were emotionally hurt by someone you trusted. As you look back now, you may still feel angry, frustrated, and disappointed all at the same time, and the hurt still pierces your heart.<br><br>

But in the midst of your pain, I want to challenge you to start involving Jesus. See the Lord holding you, gently healing your wounds. Jesus is right there restoring you, putting courage into your heart, and taking away all the sense of shame and guilt.<br><br>

Beloved, He wants you to know that your past will not determine the future that He has for you. Once you involve the Lord and put Him into your bitter waters, He will turn the bitterness into sweetness.<br><br>

That is what the Lord did for the children of Israel. When they came to a place called Marah, they could not drink its waters because they were bitter. Moses cried out to the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree, which Moses cast into the waters. When he did that, the Bible says that “the waters were made sweet.”<br><br>

Why did the foul-tasting, undrinkable waters become refreshing and sweet? The answer lies in the tree that was cast in. The tree is a picture of the cross on which our Lord Jesus hung, bearing every broken heart and every sting of betrayal.<br><br>

When you bring Jesus into your situation, He can cause every bitter experience to become sweet! Talk to Him and allow His presence to restore you to wholeness today!

           Over the last two decades, I’ve had the privilege of ministering to precious people from all walks of life. I’ve had the honor of meeting people in my congregation and at conferences around the world and hearing their stories. For those whom I didn’t get to meet in person, their letters and emails to me told their stories.<br><br>

Stories of liberation from years of anxiety and depression. Stories of being rescued from the prison of fear. Stories of breaking loose from destructive habits and addictions.<br><br>

Yet, for every person who found their breakthrough, I also know of many who are still struggling today. They are bound by severe insecurities, trapped by all kinds of disorders, and gripped by constant fear. They’ve tried every solution they can think of, but are still desperately clawing to be freed from their emotional and physical prisons.<br><br>

How did those who experienced victory break free? Why are others still trapped?<br><br>

The answer is simple but powerful: their beliefs. What you believe is critical.<br><br>

You see, if you believe wrong, you will struggle with wrong thoughts. Wrong thoughts will produce unhealthy emotions that will lead to toxic feelings of guilt, shame, condemnation, and fear. And those wrong feelings will ultimately produce wrong behaviors, actions, and painful addictions.<br><br>

Wrong believing starts you on a path of defeat. It is what keeps you trapped and drives you deeper and deeper into paralyzing captivity. Right believing, on the other hand, is the door out of this vicious cycle of defeat. When you believe right, you will live right. Right believing always produces right living.<br><br>

Today, begin to believe right by choosing to know and believe in the powerful truths of God’s Word and in His love for you. In the days to come, set your heart to discover and meditate on the Savior you have in Christ and what He has already accomplished for you. Choose to renew your mind with God’s truths about who you really are in Christ and how precious you are to Him. I pray that as you begin to encounter the person of Jesus, you will begin to experience your breakthrough and lasting victory!

           The Bible declares that the Word of God is the opposite of death—it is living and powerful. No wonder our Lord Jesus, when explaining the parable of the sower, tells us that when the sower sows the Word, “Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts” (Mark 4:15).<br><br>

Did you notice that the enemy comes immediately? Jesus was referring to the seeds that “fell by the wayside,” but the principle I want you to see is that the enemy wants to steal the Word from our hearts because he does not want you to “believe and be saved” (Luke 8:5, 12).<br><br>

The devil knows that if you receive the Word and believe it, you will be saved. This is why he will do all he can to stop the Word of God from taking root in your heart. He knows that if it stays long enough, it will be your victory and his defeat!<br><br>

The word used for saved in the original Greek is the word sozo, which means “to save one from injury or peril; to save a suffering one from perishing, for example, one suffering from disease; to make well, heal, restore to health.”<br><br>

The enemy knows how potent the Word of God is. Do you?

No matter what channel you use to spend time in His Word, make sure you are well watered with the Word. As you keep yourself drenched and watered with the Word of God, I believe you will unconsciously and effortlessly get stronger and stronger, healthier and healthier.<br><br>

While the healing you are believing for may not be immediate, believe that it is on its way. If you have been waiting for a while for your healing and you are feeling discouraged, let this promise from God strengthen you:<br><br>

“For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and do not return there, but water the earth, and make it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.”<br><br>

—Isaiah 55:10–11<br><br>
God’s Word of healing is so powerful that it will not return to Him void, but it shall accomplish His purpose. Maybe you have partaken of the Communion, and you have prayed, but nothing seems to be happening. You may even feel like you are just going through the motions because discouragement has set in. What do you do?<br><br>

Keep on watering the seed of the Word of God with the rain of His Word. Don’t give up. The harvest is coming!

            Do you believe that our God is a BIG God of abundance and inexhaustible supply? He is the Possessor of heaven and earth. He is not El Cheapo. He is El Shaddai—the Almighty, all-sufficient and all-nourishing one! And in Christ, the abundance of God’s wisdom, favor, ability, strength and creativity that you need for a successful family, career and ministry, are yours to experience and enjoy.<br><br>

I want to challenge you to break out of a mentality of lack by choosing to fix your eyes on an abundant God, who has put His unlimited resources at your disposal because you are His beloved child.<br><br>

What is your lack today? Do you need a job? Do you need more time? Or do you just feel overwhelmed by the demands of family and work? Instead of seeing the lack, start seeing a BIG God providing for you out of His abundance, a job you’ll love, wisdom to manage your time and shalom-peace at work and at home.

            The prayer of protection declares, “Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place, no evil shall befall you” (Ps. 91:9–10, boldface mine). The Word of God does not say that no evil shall befall “the world.” It says that no evil shall befall you. Verse 10 goes on to say, “nor shall any plague come near your dwelling,” and that includes your family. Beloved, let this Scripture strengthen and anchor your heart. Because you have made the Lord your refuge, no plague will come near your dwelling. Protection from strains of viruses that science does not yet have a cure for—Ebola, Zika, or AIDS—is God’s promise to you and your household!<br><br>

Have you made the Lord your refuge? Today’s Scripture says, “It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.” Interestingly, the Hebrew word for “trust” is chacah, which is the root word for “refuge” in Psalm 91.<br><br>

In other words, to make the Lord your refuge is to trust Him in all things. Trust Him with your plans, with your life, and with your family. Trust Him for His leading and wisdom. Confide in Him. Our Lord Jesus is not distant; He is not a Savior who is far away. He is so personal…so near you. There is safety and protection when we draw near to Him and dwell in His sweet presence, His Word, and His house.<br><br>

In the natural, the world is getting darker and darker. But don’t look around you and be distressed. Don’t look inside you and be depressed. Look to the Lord Jesus and be completely at rest!

           To see the power of right believing in your daily life, I want to show you some practical ways in which you can be transformed by the renewing of your mind.<br><br>

Right believing is all about renewing your mind and uprooting the wrong beliefs that shape your thinking and behavior. That’s why the Word of God says, “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think” (Rom. 12:2).<br><br>

God wants to change the way we think by shifting our thoughts from self-occupation to Christ-occupation. Our human tendency is to be focused on ourselves. We are prone to excessive self-introspection and are easily susceptible to becoming preoccupied with ourselves rather than with Jesus.<br><br>

Many of our greatest pains, struggles, failures, and miseries stem from us being “I” centered. Oftentimes, we are engrossed with thoughts such as, “Have I done enough?”, “What is wrong with me?”, and “Why do I have so many weaknesses?” Unfortunately, when we become overly occupied with self, we become obsessed, oppressed, and inevitably depressed.<br><br>

My friend, is your mind filled constantly with thoughts of how you have failed, how you have missed it, and how unworthy you are? That is symptomatic of someone who is clearly self-occupied.<br><br>

Thoughts like that cause a person to develop an inferiority complex. People who suffer from this are ever ready to condemn themselves. Their minds are clouded with negativity and pessimism.<br><br>

But self-occupation can also manifest at the other end of the pendulum’s swing as a superiority complex. There are people who think they are always better than everyone else. They are painfully arrogant, and they think their perspectives and opinions are always right. Whether you are feeling superior or inferior, your focus is still on yourself, and in the end that causes you great pain, misery, and heartache.<br><br>

Only in Christ will you experience true transformation and walk neither in pride nor in false humility. When you are Christ-occupied, the flesh in you becomes inconsequential and you begin manifesting all the lovely, wholesome, and beautiful attributes of Jesus unconsciously.<br><br>

The fruit of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, and kindness, flow through you effortlessly when your mind is renewed and occupied with the person of Jesus. It’s an inevitability! You cannot touch His grace and not become holy any more than you can touch water and not get wet.

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>“And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ And they began to be merry.”</i><br></font>Luke 15:20–24</h3>
            Do you want to see how your heavenly Father responds when you have failed? Then I encourage you to read the entire parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15:11–32. Better yet, if you are feeling stressed and worried about something, take time to pull away from life’s hustle and bustle and simply meditate on Jesus’ words in this story and let His message to you soak in.<br><br>

When Jesus shared the story of the prodigal son, all the Jewish people who heard Him would have been familiar with the condemnation and punishment (death by stoning) that the law specified for a stubborn, rebellious son (Deut. 21:18–21). However, instead of the law they were familiar with, Jesus revealed the Father’s heart of grace and forgiveness in the new covenant. Hallelujah!<br><br>

Did the son sin against his father? Yes, most definitely. But did the father heap guilt and condemnation on his son before he received his son? No, he did not. Did it matter to the father that his son’s intention for returning home was simply because he was hungry? No, it did not.<br><br>

When the prodigal son “was still a great way off,” his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his son’s neck and kissed him. What a wonderful picture of God’s heart of love!<br><br>

This is an eyewitness account of what God the Father is like from Jesus Himself! See how He described God’s response to those who have sinned.<br><br>

How is it that the father saw his son even when he was still a great way off? That’s because the father had been waiting and longing for his son to return. He must have kept his eyes on the horizon daily, hoping that each day would be the day his beloved son returned home.<br><br>

Beloved, can you see God’s heart of love for you even when you have failed Him? You just have to take one step toward God and your loving Daddy in heaven will run toward you with no condemnation.<br><br>

He wants to embrace you, kiss you, and lavish you with His love and blessings! He is waiting to clothe you with the robe of righteousness, put the signet ring of authority back in your hands, and shod your feet with the sandals of right standing. He wants to reinstate you, wash you, and throw a party because you came home!<br><br>

Our God is a God who will run toward you with no condemnation! You can come boldly to God today and experience the intimate love of your heavenly Father in a deep and personal way as never before. I pray that this experience will heal, renew, restore, and transform you in a spectacular way because His love for you is nothing less than spectacular!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>“To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.”</i><br></font>John 10:3–4</h3>
           There are many today still fighting for the voices of Moses and Elijah—the law and the prophets—not fully understanding that in the new covenant, it is all about hearing the voice of the resurrected Son of God.<br><br>

Why does the Father want us to hear only the Lord Jesus? Why are we to focus on Jesus and grow in the knowledge of His grace? Because neither the law nor the prophets hold the answer to our deepest cry for intimacy and peace with God, and to enjoyment of His presence and power in every area of our lives. If you look at Scripture, you will see that while Moses and Elijah did mighty exploits, both great men of God still failed in the end.<br><br>

Toward the end of his life, Moses hit the rock twice in disobedience, yelled at the people, spoke unadvisedly with his lips out of anger and impatience, and wound up not being allowed to enter the promised land. That’s how his ministry ended.<br><br>

Why were the consequences of Moses’ actions so severe? Because he misrepresented God. In his anger, he represented God as angry and judgmental toward His people, when God actually loved and cared for them. This tells us that as preachers of God’s Word, we need to be very accurate in how we represent God.<br><br>

What about Elijah? Despite amazing victories and evidence of the power of God in his ministry, in his last days, Elijah thought Jezebel was greater than God and fled from her. His ministry ended in depression and discouragement (1 Kings 19), with his mantle going to Elisha.<br><br>

In comparison, where the law and the prophets failed, our Lord Jesus succeeded. Look at this beautiful prophecy of the Messiah in Isaiah 42:1, 3–4:<br><br>

<i><center>Behold! My Servant whom I uphold,<br>
My Elect One in whom My soul delights! . . .<br>
A bruised reed He will not break,<br>
And smoking flax He will not quench;<br>
He will bring forth justice for truth.<br>
    He will not fail nor be discouraged.</center></i><br><br>
Whereas Moses failed and Elijah became discouraged, the Scriptures tell us that our Lord Jesus, the altogether lovely One, “will not fail nor be discouraged.” Whereas Moses was impatient, our Lord Jesus is patient with you and me today especially when we make mistakes and fail. And whereas Moses failed to bring God’s people into the promised land, our Lord Jesus finished the work His Father sent Him to do and has ushered us into all of God’s blessings and promises (Eph. 1:3, 2 Cor. 1:20). Whereas Elijah became discouraged, Jesus was not discouraged even by people’s repeated rejection of Him.<br><br>

He is your rock and your fortress when you are feeling discouraged. All the greatest men of God in the Old Testament put together cannot compare with our beautiful Lord Jesus Christ!<br><br>

This is God’s beloved Son and today He says to you, “Arise. Stand in My righteousness and be lifted up from defeat.” In the same way that our Lord Jesus could touch a man with leprosy and make him whole, He can touch any area of deformity, weakness, or shame in your life and transform it into wholeness and strength by His grace.

            Isn’t the above passage beautiful in the King James Version? You can make the Lord your habitation. First John 4:16 says, “God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.” The more you stay in His love, the more God Himself becomes your dwelling place. No evil shall befall you and no plague shall come near your dwelling. And as you make Him your dwelling place, He protects your dwelling. No plague shall even come near your home! In another psalm, it is written, “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble” (Ps. 46:1). As we make the Lord our city of refuge and allow Him to put us upon His shoulders, He becomes our “very present help” even if we encounter trouble.<br><br>

Iris from Australia experienced God’s protection for herself when a cyclone hit the area she lived in. Read her testimony here:<br><br>

<i>A mini cyclone hit our street and the surrounding area recently. As I huddled in the hallway with my husband and our cat, I declared, “Thank You, Jesus, that You are the calm in the storm!”<br><br>
When the wind stopped, we went outside and saw a lot of fallen trees on the road. The trees in our street were huge and as tall as thirty meters. As a result, many cars were crushed by the trees and some houses were also damaged. My husband’s work car was damaged slightly but our family car was left unscathed. And praise the Lord no one was injured!<br><br>
As the damaged trees were being cut down across the road, I realized something. The path of the wind had cut through a few properties across the road and when it came near our house, it stopped completely! It did not come near us and our house was completely undamaged.<br><br>
    Everyone in our street was so surprised that the big tree in our backyard was untouched and that we had no cleanup of our own to do. Praise Jesus! He is the calm, peace, and protection I need!</i><br><br>
Wow, praise the Lord! I love this testimony—when the Lord Himself is your refuge and your protection, even cyclones have to stop in their tracks when they come near you!

          What a wonderful promise we have in the above passage! Did you know that angels are surrounding us and protecting us today, because God has given them charge over us to protect us! When we choose to make Him our habitation, He charges His angels to watch over us and to surround us with His divine protection.<br><br>

Now, did you know that Psalm 91:11–12 was quoted by the devil when he tried to tempt our Lord Jesus? He brought our Lord to the pinnacle of the temple and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He shall give His angels charge over you,’ and, ‘In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.’” To this Jesus replied, “It is written again, ‘You shall not tempt the Lord your God’” (Matt. 4:5–7).<br><br>

The temptation of our Lord Jesus in the wilderness is the only instance in the Bible where the devil is recorded quoting Scripture. But the devil deliberately misquoted verse 11. The devil misquotes the Bible because he is the father of lies. Verse 11 actually reads: “For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.”<br><br>

I asked the Lord why the devil left out the words “to keep you in all your ways” and He directed me to Proverbs 3:6–7, which says: “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths. Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and depart from evil.”<br><br>

You see, the devil didn’t want to say the words “to keep you in all your ways” because that would be tantamount to reminding believers of Proverbs 3:6–7—to acknowledge God in all our ways. So he conveniently left out that whole portion.<br><br>

But praise the Lord, we know that this is what the Lord has promised: “For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways”. Our part is to simply acknowledge Him in all our ways, and He shall direct our paths, protecting us along the way!

            Jesus had prioritized divine healing during His earthly ministry. The Bible tells us that He went about “doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil” (see Acts 10:38). In fact, anyone and everyone who came to Him for healing—whether it was for their children, servants, friends or for themselves—received their healing. Not a single one who had come to Him went away without receiving healing from Him.<br><br>

And Jesus, who is “the same yesterday, today, and forever”, will do the same for you today. His heart still beats with compassion for you. He will never miss an opportunity to do good to you—to heal you of your broken body, emotional scars and weary spirit—and to bless you!

           I received an awesome testimony from twenty-five-year-old Nathan from New York, who grew up with no father figure in his life except a man whom his mother married and who beat him regularly from the time he was three. Nathan struggled with his identity, his addictions, and his anger. But his turning point came when he learned that his Daddy God loves him. He wrote:<br><br>

<i>I heard a sermon of yours about being God’s beloved. I had never heard someone speak about Jesus as someone who died for my sins because He loved me so much. I thought there was no way anyone would die for me if they knew what I’d done. But the love I felt as I listened was something I’d never experienced before.<br><br>

    I had to know more, so I bought your book Destined To Reign, and the Lord’s words through your book changed my life . . . I’ve dropped every bad habit—everything—in my past and have given myself to the Lord Jesus Christ. Every day seems new to me, and I see life in a different light now. I know that I have a Father in heaven who loves and accepts me. I know that He hears my prayers and won’t be slow to answer them.</i><br><br>

In the same way, I pray you will have a revelation that you are right now loved by the Father and close to His heart. That your Daddy God always hears your prayers and is more than able and willing to lift you out of every dark pit and set you in His love and light.<br><br>

Right now, I want you to do something: close your eyes and just say, “Daddy.”<br><br>

That’s a prayer right there. In fact, that’s the deepest, most intimate prayer you can pray. Call upon your Daddy God because He loves you and cares for you. You never did anything to make Him fall in love with you. And beloved, there is nothing you can do, nothing you could have done, that will ever take away His love for you.<br><br>

I want you to know today that as a child of God, you don’t need to qualify for His love in any way. You are already His beloved. You may feel that you are far away from Him, but your Father sees you. He has been watching and waiting for you to come home, ready to sprint toward you to embrace you. He wants to lavish His love and kisses on you, over and over again.<br><br>

You don’t need to earn your Daddy’s love. ALL that He has is already yours. He’s not asking you to serve Him in order to earn His blessings. ALL that He has, He has already freely and unconditionally given to you.<br><br>

He gave up His only Son to die an agonizing death on the cross for the chance that you might one day accept His love. So come. Come to the Father. Come with all your failings, with all your brokenness, with all your inadequacies.<br><br>

Come as you are. As you realize that you are the object of His love, I pray that whatever is negative or destructive will be flushed out from your life and you will experience breakthrough after breakthrough like never before.

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</i><br></font>2 Corinthians 5:21</h3>
            Once, the Lord showed me a vision of what happened at the cross. I saw how all the sins of the entire human race (lies, deceit, envy, bitterness, adultery, addiction, bondage, murder) and all the consequences of sin (fear, sicknesses, guilt, disease, and condemnation) swirled around Jesus like evil spirits and demons, laughing heinously, taunting and tormenting Him. Jesus became like a magnet for all sin and of His own volition accepted all this sin into His own body.<br><br>

You and I will never be able to imagine the excruciating pain that tore through His body at the cross. Every malignant cancer, every tumor, every sickness, and every disease came upon Him at the same time. He who knew no sin took upon Himself the mountainous weight of all men’s darkest and foulest sins. He took it all Himself.<br><br>

The Word says that “He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses” (Matt. 8:17). “Himself”—a singular, reflexive pronoun that signifies the exclusion of you and me. Since He Himself has taken the full punishment, judgment, and condemnation for all sin, you and I are excluded from every punishment, judgment, and condemnation for all sin when we receive Him as our Savior.<br><br>

But the story did not end there. Jesus did not die on the cross in the middle of receiving upon Himself all of humanity’s sins. He took it all and accepted it all in His body. Then the fire of God’s judgment was unleashed upon His own precious Son, and only when every last sin had been punished did Jesus cry out, “IT IS FINISHED!” moments before breathing His last breath (see John 19:30). Can you see that? Jesus held on at the cross until every single sin that you have ever committed and will ever commit was punished in His own body. That is why we call what Jesus has accomplished at the cross a “finished work.”<br><br>

Now, what is your part today? Your part is to believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of your life and that all your sins have been paid for at the cross. If you believe that all your sins have been forgiven, sin will have no more power over you. You don’t have to walk around with “a mountain of sin” on your shoulders anymore because this “mountain of sin” was laid squarely on the shoulders of another—Jesus. He Himself has already paid the price for your sins, so stop condemning yourself!

For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes; but its leaf will be green, and will not be anxious in the year of drought, nor will cease from yielding fruit.</i><br></font>Jeremiah 17:7–8</h3>
           Let’s look at some of the pictures that the Bible paints for us in Jeremiah 17. God’s Word is amazing. He speaks to us through word pictures and imagery in the Bible.<br><br>

For example, Jeremiah 17:5–6 paints us a picture of a cursed man—“a shrub in the desert.” What a dismal image of a man! A person who is always trusting in himself is like a dried-up shrub, looking old, tired, and haggard.<br><br>

But thank God the Bible didn’t just stop with the description of the cursed man. It goes on to paint a beautiful picture of a blessed man: “Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, and whose hope is the LORD. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, which spreads out its roots by the river, and will not fear when heat comes; but its leaf will be green, and will not be anxious in the year of drought, nor will cease from yielding fruit.”<br><br>

Wow! I know which man I would rather be. Truly, a picture is worth more than a thousand words! I want you to see yourself as this tree planted by the waters today!<br><br>

When I was on vacation with my wife, Wendy, in the breathtaking Canadian Rockies, we spent a lot of time just roaming around and soaking in the splendor of our heavenly Father’s creation. As we wandered along the bank of a tranquil river that we chanced upon, we found a majestic tree anchored by the water’s edge. Its trunk was sturdy and strong, and its branches stretched out to form a perfect canopy above it. In contrast to the other trees that were further away from the river, its leaves were refreshingly green and luscious. This was because the tree was constantly nourished by the river.<br><br>

Looking at that impressive, beautiful tree, I couldn’t help but recall the blessed man described in Jeremiah 17, and I remember saying to myself then, “I am like this tree in Jesus’ name!” When you depend on and trust in the Lord, you are like this tree too.<br><br>

Jesus will cause you to be a picture of robust strength, vitality and good success. See yourself like a beautiful tree planted by the waters. God’s Word says that even when heat comes, you will not fear it!<br><br>

Did you notice a crucial difference between the blessed man and the cursed man? While the cursed man cannot see good when it comes (Jer. 17:6), the blessed man will not fear even when heat comes!<br><br>

The King James Version says that the blessed man “shall not see when heat cometh.” This is amazing. It means that heat comes even to the blessed man but he is not conscious of seasons of heat, but continues to be strong and to flourish. He will be like a tree whose leaf continues to be green.<br><br>

When you are like the blessed man, you will be evergreen! This means that you will enjoy divine health, youthfulness, vitality, and dynamism.<br><br>

When you are blessed, your body will be full of life as the Lord renews your youth and vigor. Your health will not fail you nor will you lose your youth. There will be no stress, fear, and panic attacks because the blessed man “will not be anxious in the year of drought.”<br><br>

A year of drought speaks of a severe famine, and in our modern vernacular, it would be no different from the global financial meltdown, the subprime crisis, the collapse of global investment banks, the volatile stock markets, and rising inflation. While it may be bad news for the world, the blessed man can remain at rest and not be anxious because God has promised that even in the midst of a crisis, he will not “cease from yielding fruit.”<br><br>

Beloved, be the blessed man who puts his trust in the Lord and this will also happen to you!

            There is another reason we can rejoice in the knowledge that Jesus has borne the punishment that was due us: forgiveness and healing go hand in hand. The Bible says that He who never broke a single law of God “was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed” (Isa. 53:5). Do you see how healing and the price for our forgiveness are so closely intertwined in God’s Word?<br><br>

Many today are struggling to heal themselves from their sicknesses, diseases, mental dysfunctions, and addictions. I want to announce to you today that our part is to receive forgiveness from Jesus and to believe that we are forgiven every single day. The more forgiveness-conscious we are, the more easily we will experience healing and liberty from every bodily ailment, mental oppression, and destructive habit.<br><br>

One of my favorite psalms goes like this: “Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless His holy name! Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases” (Ps. 103:1–3). Now which comes first? The consciousness that all your sins are forgiven precedes the healing of all your diseases!<br><br>

And the operative word here is all. Some of us are comfortable with receiving partial forgiveness in certain areas of our lives. But we refuse to allow Jesus’ forgiveness to touch some dark areas—areas that we can’t let go of and that we can’t forgive ourselves for. Whatever those mistakes may be, I encourage you to allow Jesus to forgive you of all your sins and receive healing for all your diseases.<br><br>

My friend, let the past go. Let the mistakes go. Allow yourself to be free, and learn to forgive yourself by receiving with an open heart Jesus’ total and complete forgiveness today.

           Imagine this: you are about to enter into a time of worship in church and as the leader gives the invitation, he asks you and all the other believers to first search your hearts for any sin that would keep you from the Lord’s presence. Tell me, what happens to your heart when you begin to search for sin? And what happens to your worship?<br><br>

One of the things that I was taught during my formative years as a Christian was that I had to search my heart for sin before I could worship the Lord. Each time I did so, I felt as though I was entering a dark and dingy storeroom full of cobwebs. I pictured myself peering around and searching for all my sins with a little torchlight. Been there? And the more I searched, the more I found and the more I felt unworthy to enter God’s holy presence.<br><br>

So instead of being more conscious of the beauty and love of my Savior, I became more and more conscious of my sins, uncleanness, and guilt. Initially, my hands would be raised and I would be all ready to praise and worship God. But the more I searched my heart for sin, the more my hands would hang down with dejection.<br><br>

How could I worship God? How could I have the courage and audacity to enter His courts with praise?<br><br>

As I grew and matured in the things of God, I realized that the idea that you had to be “right” before you could worship Jesus is man’s tradition. For instance, the woman in Luke 7, who came to Jesus with an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, simply fell at His feet and worshiped Him. She washed His feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair before anointing them with the oil.<br><br>

The Bible clearly records that the woman was a sinner, and many believe that she was a prostitute, but it says nothing about her stopping to search her heart or confess her sins before she worshiped Jesus. She worshiped Him just as she was, and after that, Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”<br><br>

I believe that the devil has tried to rob us of this tremendous truth. Whatever your need is, whether you are mired in debt, trapped in a particular sin, or fearful for your future, come to Jesus.<br><br>

He is your Savior. He is your healer. He is your provider. He is your peace. He is your forgiveness. He is your “I AM” (Ex. 3:14), which means that He is the great “I AM” for whatever you need Him to be in your situation.<br><br>

Whatever lack you may be facing right now, He loves you and He is your solution. Come and worship Him just as you are, and He will meet you at your point of need. You don’t have to worry about the mistakes you have made because you are worshiping your forgiver. You don’t have to worry about your sickness because you are worshiping your healer. If believers really knew this truth, even wild horses would not be able to stop them from coming to worship God!<br><br>

Beloved, come and worship with the boldness and confidence that this woman did. You will hear Jesus say, “Your sins are forgiven. Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”

            It is wonderful to know that God does not measure and judge you based on your performance today. Instead, He looks at Jesus, and as Jesus is, that is how He sees you. His Word declares that “love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world.”<br><br>

As new covenant believers, we do not have to fear the day of judgment simply because all our sins have been completely judged at the cross, and as Jesus is, so are we! Notice that it does not say that “as Jesus was on earth, so are we in this world.” That would have been amazing enough because during Jesus’ ministry on earth, healing, blessings and abundance followed Him everywhere He went. Yet, that is not what the Word says. What it says is, “as Jesus is” (notice the use of the present tense). In other words, as He is right now, so are we in this world.<br><br>

What a powerful revelation! Just consider where Jesus is today. The Bible tells us:<br><br>

He [God] raised Him [Jesus] from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.<br><br>
—Ephesians 1:20–23<br><br>
Jesus is seated at the Father’s right hand today, in a position of power and authority. If I were you, I would take some time to meditate on this passage because the Bible tells us that as Jesus is, so are we right now, in this world. Meditate on how as Jesus is “far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named,” so are we! See it in God’s Word for yourself. See yourself as Jesus is, far above every principality and power, far above every disease and physical condition, far above every kind of fear, depression and addiction, and begin to reign over every negative situation in your life today!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</i><br></font>Psalm 23:1</h3>
          A well-known picture of God as our Shepherd and healer is articulated in the beautiful Psalm 23. It was written by David, a shepherd who saw the Lord as his Shepherd. Take a moment and read the psalm for yourself in your Bible.<br><br>

When you see the Lord as your Shepherd, you will not lack, and that includes not lacking for health. Whatever needs you have, you will not lack because your Good Shepherd provides.<br><br>

You don’t have to run yourself ragged trying to take care of everything and live as though you have no God. Whatever medical condition you are faced with, stay close to the Shepherd and allow Him to provide for you.<br><br>

And did you notice the first thing the Shepherd does? The psalmist wrote, “He makes me to lie down in green pastures” (Ps. 23:2).<br><br>

When you allow Him to be your Good Shepherd, He will bring you to green pastures and make you lie down. You can rest, for He will provide for you. He will lead you beside still waters where you can drink and be refreshed. The Hebrew word for “still” is manuka, which means “rest.” He wants you in a place of resting in the victory He has already won at the cross.<br><br>

It is not by coincidence that many of Jesus’ healing miracles took place on the Sabbath. He healed a man with a withered hand (Matt. 12:10–13), a woman bowed down for eighteen years (Luke 13:10–13), a man with dropsy (Luke 14:2–4), and another man with a thirty-eight-year infirmity at the pool of Bethesda (John 5:2–9), all on the Sabbath.<br><br>

God told His people to observe the Sabbath as a day of rest (Ex. 20:8–11). When we rest, God works; when we work, God rests. I don’t know about you, but I can’t afford not to have God working in every area in my life!<br><br>

Maybe you or your loved ones have been dealing with a chronic condition. Allow me to explain that “rest” doesn’t mean you don’t do what your doctors have advised or don’t carry out the physiotherapy exercises prescribed to you, and you simply sit at home in denial. Rest is not inactivity; it is Spirit-directed activity where you allow the Holy Spirit to lead you in what to do, and you do it without worrying because you know He is in control.<br><br>

Do you want to know the result of allowing the Lord to give us rest?<br><br>

Let me show you what King Solomon said:<br><br>

But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence.<br><br>

—1 Kings 5:4<br><br>
Don’t you love that? I pray that you will experience that in Jesus’ name—to come to a place where there is neither adversary nor evil occurrence in your life. Amen!

            My dear reader, the more you grow in your revelation and valuation of how Jesus’ finished work has placed you in Him—in the secret place where you are safe, protected, and secure—the more you’ll find your heart at rest instead of filled with worry and fears. Something powerful happens in your heart and in your outward circumstances when you begin to value being in Christ, in the secret place of the Father’s care, protection, and love.<br><br>

Let me give you an illustration of what it means to value something. Suppose I brought you an old, dusty violin with two missing strings and I said to you, “Isn’t this beautiful?” Your reaction would probably be, “That’s not beautiful; that’s old and worthless.” But if I told you it’s an original Stradivarius that used to belong to a world-famous violinist, all of a sudden, your appreciation of this dusty, old violin would swell and you’d ask if you could hold it. What happened? Your appreciation of the violin changed when you understood its true value.<br><br>

In the same way, I want to encourage you to value the preciousness of what it means to be in Christ—being in the secret place of inseparable closeness with Him, where we have His loving presence constantly with us, watching over us and protecting us. I strongly encourage you to keep hearing anointed preaching that keeps revealing who you are and what you have in Christ. Keep hearing grace-based teachings on God’s promises to protect you, as well as praise reports of God’s grace and protection over His people. Why? Because as you do, you’ll begin to value being in the secret place more and more. As you do, you’ll find your heart and mind more and more at rest in Him. You’ll wake up every morning confident of His tender care, protection, and preservation. You’ll live life full of hope and zest instead of worry and fear, and see Him deliver and protect you from whatever the enemy may throw at you!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God….For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.</i><br></font>Hebrews 10:12, 14</h3>
           Many believers are worried that when people receive the revelation of their total forgiveness in Christ, they will grow lax, take sin lightly, and go on to lead godless lives. They are worried that such teaching places no emphasis on sanctification or the desire to live holy, God-glorifying lives.<br><br>

So allow me to explain here that while you have been justified and made righteous by the blood of Jesus or perfected forever, sanctification is an ongoing process in your growth as a Christian. This is why the author of the book of Hebrews says that we are being sanctified even though we are perfected forever by Christ’s one act of obedience at the cross (see today’s scripture).<br><br>

As a believer you cannot become more righteous but you can become more sanctified or holy in terms of how you live your life. Justification by faith happened instantaneously—the moment you received Jesus, you were forgiven, cleansed, perfected in righteousness, and saved. You were also sanctified in Christ (Heb. 10:10).<br><br>

However, it is important to understand that the revelation and outworking of your sanctification in Christ is progressive. This means that the more you grow in your relationship with the Lord Jesus, the more holy you will become in every area of your life.<br><br>

I remember a precious brother writing to my ministry describing how the revelation of our forgiveness in Christ brought him into an intimacy with God that he had previously only dreamed about. “Previously, when I was trying to be a good Christian,” he said, “I was only crawling along, inch by inch. But now that I’ve got hold of grace, I’m running in my relationship with God! The more I learn about God’s amazing grace, the more I desperately want to glorify Him with my life!”<br><br>

What a beautiful, true-life picture of what really happens when a person sits under teaching that uncovers the undiluted gospel of glorious grace! The revelation of forgiveness does not detract from nor is it at the expense of right living. Instead, it is the fuel that makes right living happen.<br><br>

Merriam-Webster Online describes sanctification as “the state of growing in divine grace as a result of Christian commitment after conversion.” You see, it is all about growing in grace.<br><br>

Establish yourself in the gospel of grace. Paul told Timothy to be “strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus” (2 Tim. 2:1). Peter encouraged believers to build a strong foundation with these closing words in his last epistle: “Grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ” (2 Pet. 3:18).<br><br>

My friend, grace produces true holiness. The more you grow in grace—the more you are washed, again and again, by the water of the word of God’s grace—the more you grow in sanctification and holiness, and the more you allow the Holy Spirit to correct habits and thinking that keep you in bondage.<br><br>

Beloved, when you experience the grace of our Lord Jesus, the allure and passing pleasures of sin fade in the light of His glory and grace. It will set you free to have the kind of relationship you’ve always longed for with God, one that is intimate, powerful, and full of peace, joy, and good fruit!

            Whether you are aware of it or not, what you believe affects how you live your life. What you believe determines how you think, how you perceive a situation, and, ultimately, what course of action you take.<br><br>

I’ve said this time and time again, and time and time again, I’ve also seen this principle borne out in people’s lives: Right believing always produces right living. This means that if you want to see right living in your life, you need to understand the importance of believing right. When you believe right, you can’t help but live right.<br><br>

You see, people are struggling to control their behaviors and actions because they don’t have control over their emotions and feelings. They don’t have control over their emotions and feelings because they don’t have control over their thoughts. And they don’t have control over their thoughts because they are not controlling what they believe.<br><br>

The converse is true. When you begin to believe right about God and in His love for you, you begin to change the way you see yourself and your situation. You’ll stop feeling hopeless. You’ll begin to lose your fears. And you’ll respond differently to negative people and situations.<br><br>

This is why God wants you anchored in the powerful truths of His Word to believe in His love for you. Your heavenly Father wants you to believe that He is for you and not against you. He wants you to know and believe that He is on your side, rooting for your success and propelling you toward your breakthrough with His love and tender mercies. He wants you to open your eyes to see what He sees when He looks at you—His beloved child.<br><br>

My friend, I encourage you to take time to meditate on the truths in each of these daily readings. I believe that as you do, you’ll see old defeatist thinking habits falling away. You’ll find the most stubborn of addictions supernaturally annihilated. And you’ll find a confident expectation of good for your future and destiny in Christ strengthening your heart and creating amazing days ahead for you!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>But He needed to go through Samaria. So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar...Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”</i><br></font>John 4:4–7</h3>
           I encourage you to read the remarkable story of the Samaritan woman in John 4. Considered a woman with a shady past, she was gossiped about in her village and probably shunned for being a home wrecker, a “stealer of husbands.”<br><br>

Now, hers is not a fictional story. She was a real person, just like you and me. Her problems and pain, like many of ours, were real and hounded her every day . . . until she encountered a very real Savior!<br><br>

Despite the custom of the Jews of that day to avoid any contact with the Samaritans, whom they perceived as spiritually inferior, John records that as Jesus was traveling from Judea to Galilee, “He had to go through Samaria” (John 4:4).<br><br>

Pause with me and think about these words for a moment: Had to. Needed to. Must. Words that speak not just of necessity but underscore a steady resolve and even urgency! Jesus had deliberately scheduled a divine appointment with the woman at the well, though she knew nothing about it.<br><br>

We know from the account that this ostracized, lonely woman had a life-transforming conversation with Jesus at the well. But make no mistake—it wasn’t she who sought out Jesus to talk to Him. It was the Savior who pursued the one whom others shunned.<br><br>

Do you know that He is still doing that today? Do you have a past that you are ashamed of? Are you struggling to overcome something that you know is destroying you? Do you feel all alone and that no one understands the pain you are going through?<br><br>

I want you to know that Jesus hasn’t changed. As He was for the Samaritan woman, the loving Savior is still your very present help in your time of need (Ps. 46:1).<br><br>

He knows the suffering, shame, and struggles you are going through right now. And even if what you are going through is a consequence of bad life choices and mistakes of your own doing, He doesn’t abandon and forsake you. No—a thousand times, no!<br><br>

He goes out of the way to have a personal appointment with you, to restore and rescue you. The fact that you are reading this right now is a confirmation that Jesus is reaching out to you with His love, grace, and forgiveness.<br><br>

Talk to Him as the woman did. Taste and touch His grace and compassion for you as she did. And like her, discover Jesus’ forgiveness, freedom, and strength to walk into a bright new future.

            I received a letter from a man, whom I’ll just call Patrick, who struggled with sexual addictions for more than ten years. He knew it was wrong, but he couldn’t break free from those addictions no matter how hard he tried. His conscience would plague him with reminders of his sins every time he tried to read the Word. This fed his belief that he wasn’t good enough for God and that God didn’t want anything to do with him because of his addictions.<br><br>

This man lived in this realm of self-torture day after day. Then one day he read one of my books, Destined To Reign. Through the book, he came to discover and believe in Jesus’ finished work at the cross. He said, “I just decided to rest in Jesus’ finished work, His forgiveness, His victory, His grace, and His love, and pornography and masturbation now have no power or dominion over me. It truly is awesome, especially because I had tried for more than ten years to get victory, and all it took was for me to know the truth and rest in Jesus’ finished work. All glory to God!”<br><br>

I don’t know what guilt you may be struggling with today, but God does. You no longer have to live under the dictates of your conscience, which condemns you every time you miss the mark. See the blood of Jesus cleansing your heart, and be free from the prison of guilt to experience victory like this precious brother.<br><br>

I encourage you to fill your heart with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs that are full of God’s love and grace. When your heart is full of Jesus, wrong beliefs will begin to be replaced by right beliefs. Destructive addictions will be replaced by new, positive habits. Fear, shame, and guilt will begin to dissolve in the warmth of His perfect love for you. Experience His love today!</td>

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</i><br></font>1 Peter 5:8</h3>
           Isn’t it interesting in the above passage that the devil has to seek out those whom he may devour? This means that he can’t devour everyone. Don’t surrender your authority to him and be found among those whom he can devour! Also, did you notice that he roams about like, or as, “a roaring lion”?<br><br>

I asked the Lord why the devil goes about as a roaring lion and not some other creature. He led me to Proverbs 19:12, which says, “The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion”.<br><br>

The devil is an imposter who goes about as a roaring lion because he is imitating the King of kings, our Lord Jesus, the real lion of Judah. He wants people to think that our King is full of wrath, anger, and rage against us. He comes at us roaring with the voice of condemnation, accusation, and shame.<br><br>

Satan wants you to have the impression that you have failed God, and that He is not only disappointed with you, but is also downright furious with you. Now, if you believe that about God, would you be taking refuge under the shelter of His wings? Would you be taking your rightful place of authority, power, and strength? Of course not. In fact, you will flee from God!<br><br>

Believers who are under a cloud of condemnation won’t pray the prayer of protection. They feel unworthy of God’s promises and, in fact, are expecting punishment and judgment from God.<br><br>

That is exactly where the devil wants you to be. When you run away from God, you are running straight into the devil’s snare. You abdicate your place of authority when you abdicate your place of intimacy with God.<br><br>

Beloved, you need to know this: You are loved. God is not mad at you. In Christ, you can have the confident assurance that you are forgiven, loved, and righteous (Eph. 1:7, Rom. 8:37, 2 Cor. 5:21). The Lord Jesus has taken all your punishment at the cross so that today, you can enjoy His undeserved, unearned, and unmerited favor. God sees you in Christ, who is completely spotless and without blame.<br><br>

Based on our own deeds, none of us qualify for His protection. But because of what our Lord Jesus has done for us on the cross, we can all come boldly to His throne of grace (Heb. 4:16). Because of what He has done, we qualify to dwell in the secret place with the King of kings, where the phony “roaring lion” has no power over us!

            Kate was addicted to alcohol as well as dependent on a cocktail of strong antidepressants, tranquilizers, beta-blockers, and sleeping pills. Over time, trying to cope with the high-octane demands of being a corporate highflier as well as the strain of maintaining her success and image had driven her to look for relief from all these sources. To the rest of the world, Kate appeared to have it all together. But in reality, her despair over her inability to cope without those substances only plunged her into a vicious cycle of defeat.<br><br>

Kate tried everything to beat the bottle and her depression: She made appointments with psychiatrists and psychologists and even faithfully attended support groups for alcoholics. Through these endless appointments and meetings, she experienced what she calls “a few bouts of recovery” that lasted several days at best.<br><br>

In the end, Kate found herself on the verge of giving up. But God had other plans for her. He led her to one of the leaders in my church who encouraged her to keep hearing the preached Word and praying in the Spirit. And as she kept listening to my messages on God’s grace, God began uprooting the wrong beliefs that had taken hold in Kate’s mind and replacing them with right beliefs about herself and her future.<br><br>

The more she heard, the more she was able to keep her eyes on Jesus, instead of trying to overcome the symptoms. The more she heard, the more she was able to be at rest, to see God’s blessings in the little things, and to supernaturally not even experience withdrawal symptoms. And in a short time, four long and treacherous years of addiction to alcohol disappeared for Kate.<br><br>

The same can happen for you. In a supernatural instant, you too can experience liberation from destructive habits, fears, and bondages. You may not be able to understand how grace can set you free from a long-term addiction, but you can experience it in your heart and experience His liberty in your area of challenge!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?</i><br></font>1 Kings 3:9</h3>
           Let’s take a look at the life of Solomon. When Solomon became king, he was only a young man of about 18 years old and had big shoes to fill as David's successor to the throne. Solomon was not filled with wisdom when he first ascended the throne but he was clearly very earnest.<br><br>

He went to Mount Gibeon, where the tabernacle of Moses was, to offer a thousand burnt offerings to the Lord. At Mount Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, “Ask! What shall I give you?” (2 Chron. 1:7).<br><br>

Now, think about this for a moment. What would you have asked for if you were in Solomon’s position? Solomon did not ask for riches. Neither did he ask to be honored by all men. Instead, he told the Lord, “Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of Yours?" (2 Chron. 1:10).<br><br>

The Bible records that Solomon’s request “pleased the Lord” (1 Kings 3:10) and the Lord replied, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches or wealth or honor or the life of your enemies, nor have you asked long life—but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge My people over whom I have made you king—wisdom and knowledge are granted to you; and I will give you riches and wealth and honor, such as none of the kings have had who were before you, nor shall any after you have the like” (2 Chron. 1:11–12).<br><br>

The Book of 1 Kings tells us that Solomon told the Lord, “Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?” So when Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge, he was asking for an understanding heart.<br><br>

Let’s go deeper. The word “understanding” here is the Hebrew word shama, which means “to hear intelligently.” In other words, Solomon had asked for a hearing heart—one that hears from and flows with the leading of the Spirit of God, who leads us into all truth (John 16:13). You need a hearing heart for God's wisdom to flow through you in every aspect of your life!<br><br>

I believe that the same request that pleased the Lord then still pleases Him today. God is pleased when we ask Jesus for wisdom. To ask Him for wisdom is to put ourselves in a posture of trusting and depending on His unmerited favor. Only the humble can ask Jesus for wisdom and a hearing heart.<br><br>

Although Solomon only asked for wisdom, the Lord added “riches and wealth and honor” to him. Too many people are chasing riches, wealth, and honor, not realizing that they come through the wisdom of Jesus.<br><br>

Even if someone were to come into sudden wealth, without the wisdom of Jesus to manage it, the money would be squandered away. But with the wisdom of Jesus, you won’t only be blessed, you will also be able to hold on to the blessings in your life.<br><br>

Jesus makes you safe for good success that produces lasting and abiding fruit from generation to generation!

            Today, despite whatever you are facing in life, take time to hear Jesus. If you are concerned about symptoms in your body, keep hearing and hearing about how our Lord Jesus loved to heal and still heals today. Hear how He bore the cruel Roman lashes for you, so that by His stripes, you are healed (see Isa. 53:5). Hear how He went about doing good and healing ALL who were oppressed (bodily, emotionally, and mentally) by the devil (see Acts 10:38, Matt. 9:35). Hear how when He saw the crowds waiting for His healing touch, He was moved with compassion—He didn’t see them as people with impossible demands, but as sheep without a shepherd (see Matt. 9:36). And hear how He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (see Heb. 13:8). Faith will infuse your spirit, and His divine healing and health will flood every cell, organ, and system of your body!<br><br>

Beloved, if you are anxious about the needs and demands of tomorrow, keep hearing how God is for you and not against you. Hear how He has freely given you ALL things through Christ (see Rom. 8:31–32), so that all you need to do is to freely receive ALL of His blessings, including the favor, wisdom, healing, and supply you need for whatever challenge you may be facing. Hear the Son remind you of your loving heavenly Father, Who knows your every need and promises He will take care of you as you cast your cares on Him and simply seek first His gift of righteousness (see Matt. 6:31–33). My dear friend, as you listen and become established in His grace toward you, every worry and anxiety will evaporate like mist as the morning sun comes up, and you will see His fresh supply of favor for every new need.<br><br>

And if you’ve experienced the sting of betrayal, if you’ve been hurt by the words of people close to you, or if you are just feeling plain discouraged, hear the Lord’s words of affirmation. Hear Him say to you, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.” Let these words restore your heart, bring stability to your emotions, and give you the faith to boldly say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?” (Heb. 13:5–6).<br><br>

My friend, to really grow in grace and see its fruit manifest in our lives, we need to keep hearing the Son and His words of grace, because it is so easy to slide back into being law- or demand-conscious, as opposed to being grace- or supply-conscious. Hear Him today. Hear His words of grace!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>Then the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage. So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</i><br></font>Exodus 2:23–24</h3>
           There is an enemy who wants to keep you enslaved to that medical condition in your life. The enemy wants to keep you in a place of despair and to keep you so focused on your disappointments you cannot lay hold of God’s promises for you. That is what he did to the children of Israel. When Moses told the Israelites that God would rescue them from their bondage, the Bible tells us “they refused to listen” as they had “become too discouraged by the brutality of their slavery” (Ex. 6:6–9).<br><br>

But God did not abandon them even though they refused to listen. He knew they were in a state of despair because they had suffered under the yoke of slavery for so long. Do you want to know what the children of Israel did that caused God to rescue them so mightily?<br><br>

Read this for yourself in the verse above. The children of Israel were so oppressed all they could do was groan. There was nothing left in them to compose any prayers. And the Bible tells us God heard their groaning and He remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>

I am sharing this with you because I want you to know that you do not need to craft impressive declarations of faith or do anything for God before He hears you. Just a groan will reach the throne. A simple sigh from you will reach the throne room of your Abba in heaven. If just a groan from the children of Israel could activate the covenant God had cut with their forefathers, how much more would your cry accomplish, oh child of the Most High!<br><br>

If you are in a place of discouragement about your medical condition, cry out to Him and take this additional insight from the Passover as an encouragement. I love it that God told the children of Israel to partake of the Passover lamb in this manner: “And thus you shall eat it: with a belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand” (Ex. 12:11).<br><br>

Why did they have to eat with belts on their waists, sandals on their feet, and staffs in their hands? God was telling them to be ready for their physical deliverance even as they ate the roasted lamb.<br><br>

In the same way, when we partake of the Lord’s Supper, let’s partake with faith and expectancy. Our compassionate Lord Jesus has heard our groans and He is both willing and able to deliver us from any oppression.<br><br>

Let’s partake expecting our miracle to take place, expecting our deliverance. That’s what the Israelites did despite their suffering, and they came out with not one sick, not one feeble.<br><br>

I want to see that happening for my church and for you. We may not yet have come to the place where we can say there are “none feeble,” but I believe we are on our way.

            Beloved, I want to show you how you can pray for and experience God’s divine positioning for good success today.<br><br>

There is a principle in interpreting God’s Word known as “the principle of first mention.” Every time a word is mentioned for the first time in the Bible, there is usually a special significance and lesson that we can learn. Let’s take a look at the first occurrence of the word qarah. It is found in Genesis 24, when Abraham sent his unnamed servant to look for a bride for Isaac, his son<br><br>

The unnamed servant arrived at a well outside the city of Nahor in the evening and decided to stop there. There were so many young women gathered to draw water there that he did not know who would be the right woman for Isaac. So the unnamed servant prayed this prayer: “O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.”<br><br>

The word “success” here is the Hebrew word qarah, and this is the first time it appears in the Bible. The servant essentially prayed, “Give me qarah this day.” It goes without saying that with the Lord’s qarah or positioning for right happenings, the servant found a beautiful virtuous woman named Rebekah, who became Isaac’s bride.<br><br>

We need the Lord to give us qarah every day. I encourage you to pray the prayer of that unnamed servant. Tell the Lord, “Give me success—qarah—this day,” and depend on His unmerited favor to cause you to be at the right place at the right time!

        <td class="aceem"><h3><font color= "green"><i>For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</i><br></font>John 1:17</h3>
          Do you know what makes Christianity unique and gives it the power to free people from all fears, condemning thoughts, and addictions? Many of the world’s belief systems are governed by moral codes, rules, and laws.<br><br>

But Christianity is unique in that it is not about an impersonal list of dos and don’ts. It is about having a relationship with Almighty God. And it is God working in us and for us through this relationship that brings transformation in our lives.<br><br>

Beloved, God is all about having a relationship with you today. The apostle John tells us that “the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17).<br><br>

Notice also that the law was given. This implies a sense of distance. In contrast, grace came! Grace is personal and came as a person—the person of Jesus Christ.<br><br>

The law is hard, cold, and impersonal. You cannot have a relationship with two tablets of stone. But grace is gentle and warm. Grace is not a teaching or doctrine. Grace is a person, and you can have a relationship with a person.<br><br>

God is not interested in mere obedience and submission. He is a God of love and He longs to have an intimate relationship with you.<br><br>

Jesus came and died a cruel death on the cross, paying the full debt of sin with His own life so that you and I can reign in life today. His sacrifice fulfilled every requirement of the law perfectly on our behalf (Matt. 5:17). All that we were unable to do, He did on our behalf.<br><br>

When you receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you are made holy and righteous by His blood once and for all. You can enter into a relationship with Almighty God and come boldly into His presence without any guilt, condemnation, or expectation of punishment.<br><br>

You see, when you have fulfilled your debt to the lender for the mortgage on your house, you stop sending in your monthly payments because the debt has already been fulfilled. If the lender sends you a letter demanding additional payment, all you have to do is produce the title deed to your home. In the same sense, the debt that you and I owed to the law has already been fulfilled by our Savior, Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!<br><br>

When the devil comes to accuse you with the law and shows you how you have fallen short and failed, turn your eyes away from yourself and point to the payment that Jesus made on the cross. Christ is your title deed, which is why you are called a “Christian” today.<br><br>

You are not your own. You have been purchased with the precious blood of Jesus Christ. His blood, shed for you, is what makes your relationship with God secure. It is what gives you the basis to reach out and receive your freedom from your loving Savior today!
